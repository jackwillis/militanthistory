<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Militant History</strong>
  reproduces historical documents (newspapers, pamphlets, books, and articles)
  from the Committee for a Workers’ International (<abbr>CWI</abbr>),
  from its foundation in 1974 to the formation of the
  <a rel="external" href="https://internationalsocialist.net">International Socialist Alternative</a>
  (<abbr>ISA</abbr>) in 2020.
  Our goal is to digitize and re-publish literature which is unavailable online,
  as well as to provide a convenient index for
  <abbr>CWI</abbr> material.
