newspapers broke a major story: Scientists operating the biggest machine on earth, the 27-kilometre Large Hadron Collider, claimed to have discovered evidence which disproved Einstein’s theory of relativity.

The Large Hadron Collider, deep underground below the French–Switzerland border near Geneva, powers subatomic particles to within a fraction of the speed of light. The apparent discovery of faster-than-light neutrinos, tiny subatomic particles produced at the site, would not only defy Einstein’s special relativity but would disobey the law of conservation of energy as well. (<cite>New Scientist</cite>, 7 January 2012)

Scientists eagerly awaited further experimental results. Well-known physicist and TV personality Brian Cox said that if the result was correct it opened the possibility of time travel, while another well-known TV scientist, Jim Al-Khalili, rejected the results, saying that if neutrinos have broken the speed of light, ‘I will eat my boxer shorts on live TV.’ However, the team that produced the results found problems with their measuring methods. The team leader quietly resigned under a cloud and all bets are off. It seems that Al-Khalili’s boxer shorts are safe.

Twenty years ago, newspapers ran stories of scientific results which appeared to disprove the Big Bang theory of the origins of the universe. A number of books argued the same thing. ❧
