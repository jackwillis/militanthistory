<b>[Labor Militant](/enc/lm/group/)'s website</b>
([http://www.netaxs.com/~fightbak/](http://www.netaxs.com/~fightbak/))
was hosted by a Philadelphia internet service provider called Netaxs.
It was first archived on the Wayback Machine on 20 December, 1996.

The website included transcriptions of [<cite>Labor Militant</cite>](/enc/lm/newspaper/),
information about the group, and links to ongoing campaigns and international co-thinkers.

The website was part of at least two [webrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring):
the Struggle, Solidarity, Socialism Webring and
the Communist Webring ("the left-turn lane on the Internet").
