The movement of the working class and
peasants which removed <span lang="fr">Duvalier</span> in Haiti
and <span lang="es">Marcos</span> in the Philippines reflects the
ferment which exists in the underdeveloped
countries of the world. General strikes,
partial general strikes, food riots and massive
demonstrations are commonplace as revolutionary
developments assume regional and
even continental proportions.

{% include drop-cap.html text="The crisis in" %}
the Philippines is
accompanied by the crisis in
South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan,
Indonesia and Thailand. The
crisis in Haiti is part of the
movement of workers and peasants in
all of the Latin American continent.
This developing revolution
has resulted in the ending of nine
dictatorships in the continent
over the past seven years. Regimes
which appeared unshakeable
have had to give way to the
power of the mass movements. In
Bolivia alone there were twelve
general strikes in 1985.

The most powerful country in
Africa is facing the greatest
revolt in its history. The black
youth and workers are moving
against apartheid and capitalism
in South Africa. In Sudan a
general strike overthrew the
Nimeiry regime and riots have
rocked Egypt, Tunisia, and
Morocco.

**The advanced capitalist
countries are also entering a
period of crisis and upheaval.**
The decades of economic growth,
rising living standards and
relative peace between the working
class and big business, which
were the experience during the
post-war boom, are now over.
Partial general strikes or one-day
general strikes have taken
place in Greece, Italy, Spain,
France, Belgium, the Netherlands,
Denmark, Sweden, and in
British Columbia and Newfoundland
in Canada over the
past three years. These have been
accompanied by the miners' strike
in Britain and the <span lang="de">IG Metall</span>
strike for the 35-hour week in
West Germany.

At the same time, left governments
have been elected with
outright majorities in France,
Greece and Spain. This was the
first time in the history of these
countries that there were majorities
for the left. The left parties
in Belgium, the Netherlands
and West Germany are at present
at new highs in the opinion polls
and the Swedish Social Democrats
recently won re-election.

**In the deformed workers'
states of Eastern Europe,
Russia and China, a new crisis
is also developing.** The revolution
in Poland in 1980 and 1981
showed the opposition of the
working class in these areas to
the mismanagement, corruption,
privileges and repression of the
dictatorial caste which rules
these countries.

### Economic crisis

For the first time in history, the
three sectors of the world -- the
advanced capitalist countries, the
ex-colonial or underdeveloped
countries of the capitalist world,
and the Stalinist countries -- are
simultaneously in crisis. At the
heart of this crisis is the crisis of
the productive forces and the
slowing up in the rate of growth
in these forces and in the production
of goods and services.

Between 1960 and 1973, the
Gross Domestic Product (<abbr>GDP</abbr>) of
the advanced capitalist countries
rose by 5% per year. During the
years 1973 to 1975 this fell to
1.7% per year. For a brief period
of four years from 1975 to 1979
the figure rose to 4.3% but from
1979 to 1981 it was once again
down to 1.8% per year.

In the countries of <abbr title="Council for Mutual Economic Assistance">COMECON</abbr>,
which is made up predominantly
of Eastern Europe and Russia,
average growth was 10% in the
1950s. This fell to 7% in the
1960s, 5% in the 1970s and in
1979 was 2.1% according to
official figures.

While the populations have
increased, the rate of growth in
production has slowed up. As a
result, the necessities of life can
no longer be provided to the extent
that was the case in the
years of the post-war boom.

The economic crisis in the
capitalist world is rooted in the
private ownership of the means
of production, distribution and
exchange and in the existence of
nation states. Big business cannot
overcome these contradictions
so there is the development
of over-production and over-capacity.
At present the
economics of the West operate at
only 80% of capacity in booms,
and 70% in slumps. This results
in plant closures and increased
unemployment and poverty. At
the same time protectionism
develops and further exacerbates
the crisis by cutting across world
trade.

### Reaganomics

**The developing world crisis
has not been overcome by
Reagan's upswing. The opposite is the case.**
The upswing of the past three years has resulted
in the highest level of debt in US
history. The total debt of US consumers,
corporations, farmers
and state and federal governments
rose 14% in 1984 to $7.1
trillion (<span class="all-caps">$7,100,000,000,000</span>).

The current upswing has
lasted longer than the average of
post-war upswings. This is partly due
to the increased size of the
US deficit. Another factor has
been the fall in the price of raw
materials, which has transferred
$70 billion from the
underdeveloped countries to the
advanced capitalist countries.

However, it has also increased
the debt of the underdeveloped
countries which will push forward
the revolution in these
areas in the coming years.
Reagan's response to this has
been to increase US intervention,
shown by recent events in
Central America, Libya and
Angola.

### Recession

**Reagan's upswing will collapse
in a new and deeper
recession than the recession
of 1981--82.** Inflation will soar
again. Indebted countries and
consumers, corporations and
farmers will default on their
debts and threaten banks. A new
1929 collapse will begin to
appear on the horizon.

This threatens a return to the
1930s for the advanced capitalist countries.
Already 40 million are unemployed in the 24
advanced capitalist countries
grouped in the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and
Development (<abbr>OECD</abbr>).

For the underdeveloped world
it means an absolute nightmare.
Living standards fell for the majority
of people in these countries
during the years of the post war
boom. Now, with the boom over,
outright starvation is the prospect.
50 million people starve to
death each year and 700 million
are either unemployed or underemployed
in this part of the world.

For the working class and
peasants in Eastern Europe and
Russia the developing crisis
means an attempt by the
bureaucracy to reduce their living
standards and to speed up the
rate of work. This will be accompanied
by increased repression.

**The coming period in world
history will be one of increased
instability, with the
working class and peasants in
the West rising to end
capitalism and landlordism
and the working class and
peasants in the East rising to
end Stalinism.**
Developments in
one area or in one country can
only be understood if viewed as
of this world crisis and
world revolution that is
unfolding.

### Philippines

It is in this context that the fall
of the twenty-year dictatorship of
<span lang="es">Marcos</span> in the Philippines is to be
understood. In the Philippines,
70% of the population is suffering
from malnutrition while 43%
of the workforce is unemployed
or semi-employed. Less than one
percent of the population controls
70% of the economy. While
Marcos and the capitalist class
were getting richer and richer,
tens of thousands of young
children were dying of hunger
and malnutrition-related disease.

In the last two years, the
economy of the Philippines
experienced a massive decline:
4.6% in real production in 1985.
As a result, the regime of Marcos
started to crumble under the
increasing pressure of the
masses. **The number of strikes
increased by 45% in 1985 with
the workers responding to the
brutal repression of the
regime with greater militancy
and mobilization and moving
to the leadership of the
struggle.** The strike movement
was combined with riots and demonstrations
in the towns and the increased activity of
guerilla movement of the New People's Army
in the provinces. The unemployed, the downtrodden
inhabitants of the huge slums
and other oppressed sections of
society came forward to seek a
way out of the crisis. In their
struggles, they sought political
alternatives.

In the face of these developments,
the masters of <span lang="es">Marcos</span> -- the more astute sections of
Philippine capitalism and US imperialism --
decided to dump him despite his insistence on clinging to power.
They were terrified at the potential consequences of a more radical
leadership emerging. It was the coming onto the streets by hundreds of thousands
of workers who defied the bands of <span lang="es">Marcos</span> which decisively convinced US
imperialism that <span lang="es">Marcos</span> had to go. However, without a clear socialist alternative
being given by the leaders of the Filipino working class,
they were unable to take power into their own hands and big business and the landlords remained in control.

### Working class

The presidency was assumed by <span lang="es">Corazon Aquino</span>,
one of the "Opposition" representatives of the ruling class
with the support of US imperialism.
The new government is largely made up from representatives of the old regime.
It can not and will not solve the problems confronting the Filipino people.
Aquino's government represents the interests of the landowners and the big capitalists
and therefore is unable to solve the problem of distribution of the land to the peasants.

On the other hand, the masses of the workers and the unemployed have felt their strength in the struggle.
The recent events are the beginning of a new revolutionary wave in the Philippines and the entire region.
**The processes taking place in the Philippines constitute a confirmation of the basic ideas of Marxism
that the working class is the decisive force in the revolution even in the colonial world,
refuting the arguments that guerilla movements or benevolent liberals are the key to removing dictators.**

In Haiti, the hated <span lang="fr">Duvalier</span> regime collapsed after a series of mass demonstrations of the youth,
workers, and the unemployed, and a general strike.
Once again, due to the lack of a clear socialist leadership in the labor movement,
the opportunity was lost and a new unstable regime made up of <span lang="fr">Duvalier</span>'s aides filled the vaccuum.
The collapse of the dictators in both Haiti and the Philippines marks the beginning of
a new revolutionary wave that will end either with the overthrow of capitalism and landlordism,
or the return -- over a period of five to ten years -- of a new, even more vicious repressive regime.
The collapse of these regimes also hastens the end of Pinochet in Chile, with all the
explosive impetus that will give to the Latin American revolution.

### Stalinism

The working class will also play the leading role in the struggle against Stalinism.
This was shown in the mass movement of millions of workers who built
"Solidarity" (<i lang="pl">Solidarność</i>) in Poland.
Beginning in 1980, millions of workers started demonstrations against shortages and price increases,
demanding higher wages, the right to a trade union organization, and called for an
end to the dictatorial rule and privileges of the bureaucracy.

Solidarity was set up by the representatives of the workers in <span lang="pl">Gdańsk</span>
and the membership of the organization swelled to ten million. The sweep and power of the Polish
revolution and the Polish working class is shown in the building of Solidarity.
**In three months, the Polish workers built a union with ten million members.
This is the fastest growth of a union in world history.**

Solidarity was not in anyway a movement against socialism as Reagan and other capitalist
politicians tried to present it for propagandistic reasons. The demands
of the workers supporting the Solidarity movement were democratic change in the direction
of bringing the planned economy and state ownership under workers' control and management.
At no time did the Polish working class ever demand a return to capitalism.

The movement in Poland was
a political revolution to establish
workers' democracy and open the
way for a transition to socialism.
However, tragically, without a
revolutionary Marxist leadership
at its head, the Polish working
class was led from the start
by a leadership that squandered
all the opportunities presented to
them, thus condemning the
workers to defeat. The leadership
of Solidarity did not comprehend
that it is impossible to
achieve gradual reform of the
Stalinist system, or for a genuine
democratic union movement to
co-exist with the Stalinist
bureaucracy.

### Martial law

The Stalinist castes can only
maintain their rule by ruthless
police-state methods and the
destruction of the opposition of
any kind. The bureaucracy
defends in every way its
privilege, power, income, and
prestige against every challenge
of the working class.

Then, after a period of
compromise, the regime struck and
imposed martial law and jailed
hundreds of activists in Poland.
Solidarity was forced
underground and the movement
was defeated. However, that does
not mean that political revolution
is over in the Eastern European
states and the Soviet
Union. The working class
created during the last 40 years
of industrial development
is extremely powerful as was shown
in the case of Hungary and
Poland. With even a few dozen
activists armed with a clear
perspective and program for the
political revolution at the
beginning of the events in 1980, a
genuine workers' democracy could
have been established in Poland.
The bureaucratic regime was
suspended in mid-air when the
massive general strikes occured.
The "Communist" party was
totally isolated in the face of
mass oppositon and it could only
rely on the security forces to
deal with the situation.

There was no force in Poland
preventing the working class
from taking state power. It was
held back from this task only by
the mistaken policies of the
leadership. The policies of the
Solidarity leaders were heavily
influenced by "dissident"
intellectuals and the Catholic
Church to whom they turned for
advice. Incapable of understanding
laws of revolution and the
processes they were involved in,
<span lang="pl">Wałęsa</span> and the other leaders of
Solidarity limited the movement
to demands for partial reforms
and attempted to compromise
with the bureaucracy.

What the Polish working class
needed was a decisive and
audacious revolutionary policy
and internationalist appeal to
the working class in Russia, East
Germany, Hungary, etc.,
to rise with them and overthrow their
own bureaucracies.

### Advanced capitalist countries

In the advanced capitalist countries
also the working class leads
the struggle against big
business. Struggles like those of
the thousands of shipbuilding
workers and the youth in the
barricades of <span lang="es">Bilbao</span> and <span lang="es">Gijón</span>,
those of the hundreds of
thousands of German metal
workers for the 35-hour day, the
general strikes in Greece and
Denmark and the magnificent
struggle of the British miners
and strikes in British Columbia
and Newfoundland in Canada
are examples of this.

Fundamentally, the world
balance of forces is more in favor
of the working class than any
other time in history. From the
point of view of the capitalists,
the traditional force used for
reaction -- the middle class --
have been reduced to a tiny
minority. This is especially the
case in the advanced capitalist
countries and is reflected in
Europe in the mass left organizations --
Socialist and Communist parties -- that came to power
in several countries with absolute majorities.
It is also shown in the events in France in 1968
and Portugal between 1974 and 1975.

In France 1968, 10 million workers joined a general strike
paralyzing the capitalist state, police and the military.
The factories were occupied
and the question of a peaceful
transformation of society under workers
control was posed. A similar process
took place in Portugal 1974,
when after the removal of a 40-year
dictatorship, the working
class and the peasantry took over
70% of the economy and
the land. Had a genuine Marxist
leadership existed at the head of
the labor movement in either of
these situations capitalism could
have easily been overthrown and
replaced by a genuine workers' state.

The power of the working class is shown in countries like Spain,
Greece and France where socialist governments were elected with over 50%
of the vote in every case. These governments could have nationalized
the commanding heights of the economy and planned production in order to end the
economic and social crisis. However, what they attempted was to "reform"
the capitalist system, ending up -- in every case -- with the implementation of
severe counter-reforms and austerity to "bolster industry."

France -- where the left lost its
majority in the recent
parliamentary elections to the
right wing -- shows the forces at
work. The Socialists and the
Communists came to power in 1981
with a program for change and
reforms. The parties of the left
received 55% of the vote. During
the first 12 months, the Socialist
government introduced a series
of reforms. They raised the
minimum wage, cut retirement
age to 60, reduced the work week
and nationalized some sections of
the economy.

### Counter-reforms

However, the vast majority of the economy
remained in the hands of the private sector.
Under the pressure of big business both in France and abroad,
who withdrew investment and speculated against the franc,
the Mitterand government

After a period of massive
strikes and demoralization, the
right wing returned with a
shaky majority in parliamentin
the March 1986 election.
However, even after all those
develoments, the Socialist Party
