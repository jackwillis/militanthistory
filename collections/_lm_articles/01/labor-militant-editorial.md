<cite>Labor Militant</cite> is
being produced to provide a conscious socialist alernative in the working class and the youth in the United States.
American big business is in crisis and is attempting to offload this  crisis onto the backs of American workers,
and workers and peasants internationally. All it offers is increased poverty, repression, wars,
and in the longer term of to to three decades, the threat of nuclear annihilation.

{% include drop-cap.html text="The 100-million-strong" %}
American working class is the largest working class in the capitalist world.
19 million are organized, making the American trade union movement the largest in the world.
The working class is the most powerful force in the U.S.
It, and it alone, has the power to end the dictatorship of the corporations over American society and to end capitalism.

What prevents the mighty U.S. working class from carrying out this task is the lack of conscious socialist leadership.
The <abbr>AFL--CIO</abbr> believes that capitalism is the only possible system.
As a result, the ideas of big business remain unanswered and the power of the working class is not mobilized.

<cite>Labor Militant</cite> will answer the lies of big business and argue for socialism in the U.S.A. and internationally.
We will provide the facts and figures to back up our case and to arm the labor movement for the battles that lie ahead.

We will campaign for organizing the unorganized, and for the unions to build a labor party
as an alternative to the parties of big business, the Democrats and the Republicans.
We will campaign for a socialist program for the labor party.

<cite>Labor Militant</cite> will expose the vicious racist oppression of the especially-oppressed racial minorities in the U.S.
We will campaign for the labor movement to confront this oppression and the special oppression of women,
and to unite the working class and youth of all races, male and female, within a united labor movement.
This is the only way to overcome big business's tactics of "Divide and Rule" and to end the special exploitation
of the especially-oppressed minorities as well as the exploitation of the working class as a whole.

Simultaneously with answering big business and those who echo its ideas inside the labor movement,
<cite>Labor Militant</cite> will seek to gather together the most advanced and fighting sections of the U.S working class and youth under its banner.
The task of these advanced sections will be to patiently explain the ideas of Marxism in the broader labor movement.

The developing crisis will unleash events which will open the eyes of the mass of the workers to the crisis of capitalism and Stalinism.
If the advanced sections properly fulfill their role of patient explanation and tell the truth to the working class,
it will be possible to win a majority in U.S. society to the struggle for socialism.

A socialist United States of America would herald the end of capitalism and landlordism on a world scale.
It would also end the dictatorship of the Stalinist bureaucracies in Eastern Europe, Russia, China, etc.
A new world order, a Socialist World Federation based on workers' democracies, would then be possible.
This would utilize the potential of the productive forces and the human species to end poverty, war, oppression, racism, and division.

<cite>Labor Militant</cite> is produced by trade union activists and youth throughout the U.S.A.
