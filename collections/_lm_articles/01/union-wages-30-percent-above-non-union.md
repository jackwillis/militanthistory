The wages and benefits
of union workers in the
U.S. are on average 30%
higher than non-union
wages and benefits. Safety
at work and job security is
also better for unionized
workers.

{% include drop-cap.html text="These are the" %}
reasons big business and its press try to turn
workers and youth away from unions.
They continually portray
union leaders as dictators and the
unions themselves as centers of
Mafia activity.

### Smears

Despite these smears, support for
labor unions far outweighs the
number of workers organized in
unions. In a July 1985 poll in
<cite>Business Week</cite> magazine it was
shown that 73% of Americans
agreed that unions improve wages
and conditions. Even in the South,
68% agreed wth this. This shows a
huge level of support for labor and
an understanding of the key role
unions have played in raising living
standards for workers.

In 1985, however, only 18% of
the workforce is organized in
unions. Big business and its press
have been attempting to prove that
unions are a thing of the past and
no longer relevant. To prove this
they point to a fall in the percentage
of workers organized from
35% in the 1940s to 18% in 1985.

But these figures hide the most
important process in the last 40
years. The workforce has increased
from 64 million in 1946 to 110
million in 1985. Most of these jobs
appeared in new industries,
especially the service industries,
which were not unionized. Thus the
growth in the size of the working
class must be taken into account
when considering the reduction in
the percentage of workers organized.

### 19 million

There are 19 million workers
organized in unions today. This is 4
million more than were organized in
1955 at the time of the merger of
the <abbr>AFL</abbr> and <abbr>CIO</abbr>. This makes the
labor movement potentially the
most powerful force in American
society today and the largest
organized trade union movement in
the world.

The responsibility for the low
level of organization lies not with
an anti-union workforce but with
the policies of the trade union
leaders. The labor leaders failed to
mount a campaign to organize this
new growing workforce. During the
post-war period the <abbr>AFL--CIO</abbr> spent
only 3% of its budget on organizing
while they spent 25% on
"international affairs."

### Post-war boom

During the last 40 years the
policies of the labor leaders have
been based on "labor--management
co-operation." This policy had a
certain base due to the post-war
boom. The boom allowed the corporations
to make huge profits,
enabling labor to win increased
wages for workers. With a powerful
working class on one side, and
super profits on the other side,
union leaders won improved contracts
and increased prestige. A
vast section of the working class
reached living standards never
before dreamed of while the living
standards of the union leaders rose
above those they represented.

### Organize

The present crisis and the attacks
on labor have caught the
labor leaders unprepared. But
pressure is growing on them to
organize the millions of workers
outside organized labor. <abbr>SEIU</abbr>
spent 30% of its budget on organizing
in 1985. At the 1985 <abbr>AFL--CIO</abbr>
convention Lane Kirkland, president
of the <abbr>AFL--CIO</abbr>, said, "A new
labor force has grown up around us
and the trade union share of it has
dropped. But the good news is that
we have a hell of a lot more people
to organize, and we mean to
organize them."

{:.final}
Labor must mobilize its huge
resources to reach the ear of
millions of workers and especially
the young workers facing poverty
wages, poor conditions and job
insecurity in fast-food restaurants,
the service industry, small shops,
sweat shops, and other non-union
workplaces across the country. The
main message of this campaign
should be: "Wages and benefits of
union members are 30% higher
than non-union."
