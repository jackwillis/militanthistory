In November 1983, the workers of British Columbia in western Canada drove back the attacks of
the province's right-wing Social Credit government with a partial general strike.
In the weeks of March and early April of this year, the Newfoundland workers in eastern Canada
inflicted a defeat on the right-wing Progressive Conservative government in their province.
They also carried out a partial general strike.

{% include drop-cap.html text="Road workers, transport" %}
workers, clerks and court employees all stopped work.
They were demanding parity with other workers in similar types of employment and an end to
the law which designated 49% of the workers in any public-sector bargaining unit as "essential."
This means in any strike, 49% of the workers must remain at work.

### Mass arrests

The strike of the Newfoundland workers was illegal. The government ordered mass arrests.
Over 120 workers were arrested, but mass pickets and demonstrations took place and they were rorced to end the arrests.

The Newfoundland Federation of Labor backed the 5,000 workers on strike with demonstrations and finance.
They threatened a general strike of all 80,000 workers in the province.
The New Democratic Party also backed the strike.
Their provincial leader was one of those arrested for picketing.

The strike was settled with the government promising parity of wages in the coming contract negotiations.
This strike and the B.C. strike of 1983 show the magnificent fighting traditions of Canadian labor
and its determination to fight the attempts of Canadian big business to offload its crisis on the backs of workers.

### Lessons

There are important lessons from both these strikes.
In particular, U.S. labor which is surrounded by restrictive anti-union laws should take note.
These strikes showed that where mass
support is mobilized and a determined lead given,
right-wing governments can be defeated and
anti-labor laws and arrests can
be successfully defied.

In the coming period, the great
industrial provinces of Ontario
and Quebec and the provinces of
central Canada will join the militant
fighters of the coastal belts.
When they do they will rock
Canadian capitalism to its foundations
and inspire workers
throughout all of North America.
