There are 26 million
black Americans. They
suffer 13% unemployment
while the national average
is 7%. 41% of black youth
are unemployed. Blacks
make up 12% of households
yet own only 4% of
the nation’s wealth.

{% include drop-cap.html text="Thirty-six percent of" %}
blacks and 47% of black
children live in poverty. This is in
the richest country in the world
where the number of millionaires
has now reached 1 million and
where over $313 billion a year is
spent on arms, which is more than
the total Gross National Product of
Canada.

### Black Revolution

Life for the majority of black
Americans is a nightmare. **But it is
a nightmare which has not gone
unchallenged.** The most heroic of the
black revolts of this century took
place in the 1950s and 1960s.
Malcolm X called it the "Black
Revolution." It shook white-capitalist-dominated
America to its foundations and inspired youth and workers all over the world.

Hundreds of thousands of blacks
marched and demonstrated,
occupied restaurants and public
buildings, demanding civil rights,
an end to discrimination and decent
jobs and wages. Explosions took
place in the ghettos, black workers
revolted and organized in the armed
services in Vietnam and in the
factories of Detroit.

### International movement

**This revolt was part of a worldwide
movement.** Workers, peasants
and youth moved into struggle in
Africa and the entire underdeveloped world against
capitalism and landlordism. They
fought the Stalinist dictatorship in
Hungary in 1956. They fought
capitalism in the advanced
capitalist countries as in the 10
million strong general strike in
France in 1968. And the youth
organized against the Vietnam
War. The "Black Revolution" looked
toward and in turn inspired
these events.

### Congress of Industrial Unions

This revolt came out of the struggles
to build the <abbr>CIO</abbr> and the gains
the new unions meant for black and
white workers. Black workers won
increased living standards in the
new unions and gained experience
in organizing. This raised the
expectations and the ability to
struggle of the black people as a whole.

"Black Revolution," drawing with it
sections of the white youth, won
some victories in the area of civil
rights, voting rights and racial
segregation. These were institutionalized
in the Voting Rights and
Civil Rights acts of the early 1960s
which removed most of the worst
discrimination on these fronts in
the South.

**This black revolt merged with the
revolt of the army in Vietnam, the
anti-war movement at home and the
movement of organized labor in the
strike wave of 1970--1976. American
big business moved to try to cut
across the revolt. It used repression
combined with promises of
concession.**

Black leaders were murdered,
promises were made for more spending
in the cities and the quota
system known as Affirmative Action
was introduced. Quotas of
minorities in employment were to
be monitored and enforced by
lawyers and the courts. These
measures to derail the mass movement
of the "Black Revolution"
combined with other factors and
the movement tailed off. The struggle
against racial discrimination
was removed from the streets to
the courts and lawyers of big
business. The results were predictable.
The gains made by blacks
relative to whites peaked in 1970
when the quota system came into
force.

### Camouflage

**The quota system helped a tiny
minority of mainly middle class
blacks. Their gains were used to
camouflage the fall in living standards 
of the majority.**

Between 1972 and 1982 the
number of black managers and
officials rose by 83% to 445,000. The
percentage of blacks earning
$35,000 per year rose from 5.3% in
1970 to 8.6% in 1982.

For the majority of blacks, the
working class and the unemployed,
conditions got worse. The percentage
of black households with annual income
below $10,000 per year in 1970 was 37.8%.
By 1982, this had increased to 42.6%.
Median black income as a percentage of median white income
rose from 55.3% in the early 1960s to 61.3% in 1970
under the pressure of the mass movement, but fell back to 55% in 1985.

### Oppose Reagan

**While the quota system did not work as shown by the statistics above,
and while it tended to drive a wedge between the workers along the lines of race and sex,
Reagan's attempts to dismantle the quota system must be opposed.**
If he succeeds in this it will give a green light to racists to go on the offensive against the blacks
and all especially-oppressed minorities.

The labor movement must take up the fight against racism.
In doing so it must realize that the quota system offers no way forward.
Labor must openly confront and mobilize its forces to fight racism.
It must put the struggle against racism clearly on the agenda of the labor movement.

### Labor's program

Black Americans cannot end their special oppression on their own.
They must link their struggle to the struggle of the working class as a whole.
And labor cannot win its struggle against the employers unless it fights racism.

**Labor must therefore fight on a program which can solve the problems of
all the especially-oppressed minorities: Native and Asian- Americans, Latinos, as well as blacks.
Jobs for all on trade-union rates of pay is central.**

The struggle must be taken up for a 32-hour work week with no loss of pay, and for 32 hours work or 32 hours pay.
A reduction to 35 hours in manufacturing alone would provide 3.7 million jobs.

On top of this, a crash house-building program and a public works program
must be fought for to build schols, hospitals, and recreational facilities, and to rebuild the infrastructure.
All work provided in these programs must be at union rates of pay and with union benefits.

The housing and public works programs would have as a priority the areas of greatest need.
This would not only mean the oppressed
ghettos of racial minorities but all
areas of slum housing and discrimination.
This program would unite all working-class and poor people in struggle.

### End discrimination

Labor must step up the struggle for control over hiring and firing and against discrimination on the job.
It must also set up hiring halls and fight for training facilities
under union control and with full pay in areas of high unemployment.

The union boards which control
hiring and firing must have elected
representatives from the local
areas on them as full members.
These boards must also spearhead a campaign to sign up the unemployed
at the hiring halls and at the training centers.

Labor must also see to it that its own house is in order.
Educational bodies and committees to fight racism and discrimination must be set up
at all levels to combat the racist ideas of the bosses which may have gained adherents among workers.
Racists must be banned from holding any position in the union movement
and all members of fascist organizations, such as the Ku Klux Klan, must be expelled from organized labor.

### Capitalism and racism

**In 1965, Malcolm X stated, "You cannot have capitalism without racism."
In 1966, Martin Luther King stated, "There's something wrong with capitalism...
maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism."
In 1968, Fred Hampton said, "We say we’re not going to fight capitalism with black capitalism, but we’re going to fight it with socialism."**

{:.final}
As the economic crisis worsens, the nightmarish conditions for blacks and all especially-oppressed will also worsen.
Racism, poverty, and unemployment can only be ended by a united labor movement fighting on a socialist program.
