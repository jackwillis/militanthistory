Support is growing for the building of a Labor Party. The
Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers, the United Electrical
Workers and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees
have endorsed Labor Party Advocates (<abbr>LPA</abbr>).
<abbr>LPA</abbr> chapters and recruitment committees have recently gotten off the
ground in Boston, Los Angeles and other cities.

{% include drop-cap.html text="Last December," %}
350 labor party supporters -- members of
60 unions and several community groups -- attended a Midwest conference
in Toledo, Ohio. Lisa Hane, <abbr>LPA</abbr> member
from Chicago, told the conference that if the movement is
taken forward in the next year to establish a labor party, the
meeting taking place could be remembered as historic. Other
meetings are happening across the country as union activists
come together to discuss and plan the building of a working-class
party. 120 people attended the first <abbr>LPA</abbr> meeting in
Boston. In Los Angeles, 150 showed up.

An important development
is taking place in the San Francisco Bay Area:
There, both the
Alameda County and the San
Francisco Labor Councils have
endorsed <abbr>LPA</abbr>, as have the San
Francisco Building Trades
Council, the Bay Counties District
Council of Carpenters, and
numerous local unions. This has
given <abbr>LPA</abbr> an important credibility
among union members.
However, it only scratches the
surface, as far as potential support
from union leaders and official union bodies. While in San
Francisco the leadership of the regional bodies helped initiate
the support without direct pressure from below, this has not
been the case in Alameda County (the East Bay), where a
persistent campaign from just one or two <abbr>LPA</abbr> members within
the Central Labor Council is now starting to bear fruit.

The <abbr>LPA</abbr> leadership should now mobilize its members for
a campaign within the official bodies of organized labor, from
the local unions on upto the internationals, to support the idea
of a Labor Party and endorse <abbr>LPA</abbr>. Support and co-operation
from the officials should, of course, be sought out. However,
this in no way precludes also openly raising the idea and
provoking discussion and debate on it within
these bodies.

In addition, there is the question of activities for <abbr>LPA</abbr> and
its members. There are several issues around which all wings
of organized labor are in agreement. For instance, the campaign
against <abbr>NAFTA</abbr> and for labor law reform. Support the
<abbr>AFL--CIO</abbr>'s policy for a 35 hour work week. Perhaps most
critically, <abbr>LPA</abbr> must be involved in strikes and organizing
drives. <abbr>LPA</abbr> should be mobilized to participate in such
campaigns and link them with the question of a Labor Party.

<abbr>LPA</abbr> is calling for a founding convention for a Labor Party
in late 1995. At this convention, several issues will have to be
discussed and debated out in order for a Labor Party to be
established and in order for it to solve the problems of U.S.
working people. Up to now, <abbr>LPA</abbr> has accepted that union
officials can both support <abbr>LPA</abbr> and support the Democrats.
Historically, a wing of the labor leadership in the past has
supported the idea of a Labor Party in words while in action
they supported the Democrats. Their verbal support for a
Labor Party served to put off decisive action on the question.
At its founding convention, a Labor Party should issue a clear,
unequivocal call on the labor movement and its leaders to
once and for all break all its links with both parties of big
business.

In addition, there is the question of participating in elections.
Even before the convention, there is no real reason
why <abbr>LPA</abbr> should not participate in running genuine, independent
worker candidates even at the present. Once a founding
convention is held, there should be an open commitment to
running its own candidates and should call on the labor leaders
to put all the resources of the labor movement behind them.

Finally, there is the question the program, of what a Labor
Party will fight for. In the last analysis, this is the key issue. The
question of a shorter work week, of guaranteed jobs and
income, of education, health care, etc. -- a Labor Party would
have to raise concrete demands on these if it is to succeed. But
we must not forget that millions of workers would raise one
simple question: “How are you going to pay for any advances?
Are you just going to raise my taxes?” If we lack a clear answer
to this, in the end a Labor Party will not be able to solve the
problems. The only really practical solution to this question is
to be committed to taking the 500 multinationals, who really
control the U.S. economy, and place them under public
ownership and to then democratically plan the economy,
based on what the people need, not on the profits of a tiny
minority.

All this and more will have to be discussed at the founding
convention. However,it must be emphasized that the creation
of a Labor Party on any program would be a huge step forward.
It would break the political monopoly of the bosses’ parties and
challenge the greed of big business.
