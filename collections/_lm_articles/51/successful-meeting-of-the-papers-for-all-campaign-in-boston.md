The Boston Branch of Labor Militant
recently helped kick off the Papers
for All Campaign in Eastern Massachusetts
by sponsoring a well-attended public
meeting on immigrant rights. The
featured speakers were Carlos Petroni, a
leader of the Immigrant Rights Movement&thinsp;/&thinsp;<span lang="es">Movimiento
por los Derechos de los Inmigrantes (<abbr>MDI</abbr>)</span> and a member of
Labor Militant, and Seamus Whelan, an
Irish activist, also a member of Labor Militant.

{% include drop-cap.html text="Addressing an excellent" %}
turnout of 54 immigrant workers and grassroots community
organizers, they spoke out against the
scapegoating of immigrants and attacks on
the living standards of all workers. The
speakers also made a direct invitation to
take action and to develop concrete strategies
to mobilize the campaign to achieve an
immediate amnesty for all immigrants.

As Carlos Petroni said,
> After the passage of anti-immigrant legislation,
> the repeal of welfare and the anti-terrorist law,
> immigrants are left with none of the elementary democratic rights:
> no rights to services, no right to work,
> subjected to deportation and imprisonment...
> A campaign for an immediate amnesty will allow millions
> to work and organize to fight for full rights.

The audience, recognizing this was not
more of the same old politics as usual
responded by enthusiastically contributing
to the discussion and speaking of their own
concrete experiences. Their statements,
along with the remarks of the speakers,
showed that immigrant workers are not taking
the outrageous attacks on their basic
human rights lying down.

> If there were
> enough jobs for all, good salaries and the
> right to be organized in unions --
> in other words if the economy would be organized to
> serve the needs of everyone -- we would not
> have any rationale for discrimination and
> racism. Discrimination and racism are the
> weapons utilized by the ruling class to convince
> one sector of the working class that
> another sector of the working class is responsible
> for the state of the economy instead of
> themselves. That's why, in times of
> economic upturns, discrimination generally
> subsides and re-emerges at times in which
> the economy is in a downturn. We need to
> educate the working class in the idea that
> there are not "foreigners" who take their
> jobs, there are capitalists that rob them of
> their rights, including the right to have decent
> jobs and wages.

The Papers for All Campaign, begun
several months ago in San Francisco by the
<abbr>MDI</abbr>, shows a new militancy in the
immigrant community, which has spread rapidly
bringing along with it the endorsement and
support of thousands of individuals and
organizations in the U.S. and around the
world. Labor Militant is one of these
organizations and we see the Papers for All
Campaign as an important part of the
struggle for workers’ rights and socialism.

Millions of men, women and children
living in the United States did not qualify for
the 1986 immigration amnesty. These workers
and their extended families contribute
hundreds of millions of dollars to the economy
in industrial productivity, income taxes,
and community support, but because
they are undocumented they fall under a
very real threat of deportation. Immigrant
workers are often coerced into laboring
long hours for low wages and in sweatshop
conditions. The bosses’ crimes against these
vulnerable workers are designed to set worker
against worker (divide and rule), and
drive down wages and living standards for
all working people. A reign of fear, insecurity
and discrimination -- a virtual system of
American apartheid -- has made just staying
alive the order of the day for millions of
immigrant workers and their families.

As Carlos and Seamus pointed out, the
Papers for All Campaign will succeed best
if it is led by immigrant activists themselves,
and works together in a united front with
grassroots immigrant rights organizations,
labor unions, and the newly-formed Labor
Party. Carlos Petroni emphasized:

> There is no question that the fight for rights for
> immigrants should be led by immigrants
> themselves. The strategy of Democrats and
> Republicans is to divide us and make us
> believe that this is an individual issue, that
> each of us has to fight for his or her individual
> rights to live and work in this country. This
> is false: we won't have rights unless we
> overcome the divisions and we fight together!

Labor Militant and supporters of the
Papers for All Campaign in Eastern
Massachusetts will continue to speak out, petition
make contact with concerned people im the
community, hold public meetings, support
<abbr>MDI</abbr> and keep a vigilant eye on the
Immgration and Naturalization "Service."

Carlos ended the meeting by promising:
> The Papers for All Campaign has the intention
> of building a national and an international
> movement to obtain full nghts for
> immigrants and their families, and to defeat
> racism and discrimination. The amnesty is
> just the first step, the rest will follow by the
> logic of the struggle and the movement we
> will be able to build.

{:.final}
We urge you to contact Labor Militant
to get involved in the Papers for All Campaign
and the struggle for a world without
repressive borders and for a world with
justice and prosperity for all, regardless of
their "country of origin."
