<b>Militant History</b> will print historical documents --
newspapers, pamphlets, books, and articles --
from the Committee for a Workersâ€™ International (<abbr>CWI</abbr>),
from its founding in 1974 to the formation of the
[International Socialist Alternative](https://internationalsocialist.net) (<abbr>ISA</abbr>) in 2020.
Our goal is to digitize and re-publish literature which is unavailable online,
and to provide a convenient index for <abbr>CWI</abbr> material.
