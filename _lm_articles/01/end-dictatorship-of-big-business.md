Exactly one hundred years ago, the U.S. working class took up one of the most ferocious battles of its entire history --
the battle for the eight-hour day. May 1, now celebrated by workers round the world,
was marked in 1886 by general strikes in almost every major city of the U.S.
as tens of thousands of workers struck for a shorter work week with no less pay.

{% include drop-cap.html text="Today, similar battles" %}
are brewing once again as the wages and conditions of workers are coming under vigorous assault.
First-year raises in union contracts have plummeted from about 10% in the early '70s to 2.4% in 1984.
Real wages have dropped by 14% from 1972 to 1984.
The number of "two-tier" contracts almost doubled in 1984,
hitting hardest at the younger workers just entering the workforce.

From cradle to grave, poverty
is now a way of life for many.
Some 20 million Americans go
hungry at least part of the time,
one in four children under 6 live
in poverty, and half of all black
children live in poverty. Over
12% of the aged, whose only
crime was to have worked hard
all their lives, are now in poverty too.

Perhaps the contradictions are
best summarized by the plight of
90,000 farmers in the U.S. who
are threatened with ruin and
can't sell their produce due to the
glut of grain on the world market
while millions go hungry in
every corner of the globe!

### Working class

But today the working class is
stronger than ever before and
will not give up the gains it has
made in the past 50 years
without major struggles. The
last year has seen general
strikes in Bolivia, Denmark,
Greece and Spain, the 12-month
coal miners' strike in Britain,
and the magnificant movement
of the masses of black workers
and youth of South Africa.

The U.S. working class is now
also starting to take action. The
strikes of the cannery workers in
Watsonville, CA, and the
Hormel workers of Austin, MN,
show that opposition to concessions is increasing. In its
preparation for the huge tasks
ahead, rank and file union
members are beginning to
develop anew, fighting
leadership.

The U.S. working class will
return once again to the traditions of the 1930s. The trade
unions will be transformed into
fighting democratic organizations, and in the process the demand
will be raised to *break*
with the politicians of big
business. The most powerful
working class in the capitalist
world will demand that it have
its own political party -- a labor
party, based on the unions.

This will coincide with the rising tide of the working class
movement internationally --
both East and West. However,
the U.S. Labor Party will have
to deal with the growing crisis of
the world capitalist system.

Through this struggle, through victories and defeats, times of turbulence and lulls, tremendous lessons will be learned.
It will become more and more clearly seen that 500 giant corporations constitute a dictatorship over U.S. society.

The call will increasingly grow
within the labor movement for
the nationalisation of these major corporations under the
democratic control and management of the workers -- for the
masses of workers to take control
of their own society, for socialism
and workers’ democracy is our
time.

**This was the struggle which was started 100 years ago on May Day 1886.
This is still the struggle today. The time has come to complete this task.**&nbsp;❧
