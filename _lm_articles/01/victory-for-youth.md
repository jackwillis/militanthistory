> "Youth have the worst jobs, the worst unemployment rate and the worst opportunities --
and because there's nothing to turn to we also have the worst alcohol, drug and suicide problems.
On top of that we face constant police harassment, anti-youth legislation from the City Council and
curfew proposals from the State Legislature. That's why we need a campaign to defend our rights,"

Mary Connors, a Youth Defense Campaign and Labor and Trade Union Group activist, explained to <cite>Labor Militant</cite>.
At 21, Mary's been in and out of low-paid office and factory jobs.
Her life and future is no different to the majority of American youth.

{% include drop-cap.html text="Teenage unemployment officially" %}
rose to 19% last month, nearly 3 times higher than the adult rate.
More than 55% of those youths who find work are made to suffer minimum wage.
Apprenticeships or any job training has become history.
The corporations who dictate the wages and conditions of non-union youth
expect us to be grateful for the privilege of a job: "there's many more where you came from."

"Things are getting worse. One friend told me how he'd worked in construction each summer since 1980.
He used to get 6 bucks an hour, then five, then four and last year he couldn't find any laboring work over $4 an hour."
This is the policy of Big Business.

### Profits

The corporations inflate their
super-profits off the backs of our
living standards and the youth
are hit worst by this. Sears
Roebuck had record profits in
1984 exceeding $1.3 billion at
the expense of the low paid-youth
in the retail trade.

The more attacks the youth
face, the more determined they
become to fight back. Recently in
Australia, the McDonalds Corporation went on the move
demanding 40% wage cuts which
would have resulted in
thousands of youth reduced from
semi-slave to absolutely slave
conditions. A campaign was
organized by the Austrialian
Labor Party Youth and the
Trade Union movement which
forced back the proposed attacks.
Last year,
Britain and Italy both
saw mass national strikes by
school students against organized attacks by big business on
young workers.

### International

The movement of youth in
Seattle around the newly formed
"Youth Defense Campaign"
reflects the international tendency
of youth to organize in defense
of their rights.
Stemming from the anger and frustration of youth,
who were in the firing line of a police riot last November,
the Y.D.C. launched its initial campaign to "Defend the Three"
who were indiscriminately arrested during the "riot."
The campaign grew at a rate nobody expected.
The half-dozen original Y.D.C. activists has grown to over 120 paid-up members.
Over 70 t-shirts with the Y.D.C. logo have been sold.
The program the Y.D.C. was built on is:

* End to police harassment of youth
* Repeal all anti-youth legislation
* For inexpensive decent entertainment for youth
* For decent jobs with trade union rights and conditions for all youth

### Curfew

The particular attacks the
youth in Seattle have faced have
been massive. Big Business provides
no affordable leisure
facilities for Seattle’s youth.
Added to this their henchmen in
the City Council (Republican and
Democrats) have outlawed under-18-year-olds
from attending gigs,
and the State Legislature proposed
a curfew for under-17-year-olds.
Such a curfew already exists
in neighboring Oregon.
From the start the Y.D.C. explained
that these attacks were
not isolated, but a part of a more
general attack by the corporations
who control society, on
society's most rebellious section:
the youth. If the youth are to be
teduced to semi-slavelike conditions
big business, and through
it the state, must attempt to
pacify or at least subdue the best
qualities of youth: their energy
and enthusiasm. While on the
other hand an organized campaign
against these attacks
should raise these qualities.

### Labor

Trotsky explained the necessity
of any youth movement to
unite with labor because the
youths' vitality is hindered by
their lack of experience and
because it is organized labor
which has the industrial power
a youth movement doesn't have.
It is only the power of organized
labor that can defend the rights
of youth and beyond that it is only
the organized working class
which can defeat the corporations
and take society forward to
socialism.

Already the Y.D.C. has received
endorsements from four union
locals and the Secretary of the
(Seattle) Labor Council has applauded
our campaign in its efforts
to link youth and labor. The
Y.D.C. spoke before the Labor
Council receiving a huge round
of applause from delegates.
Many more union locals approached
us offering endorsements and donations.

### Victorious

Our campaign has received
coverage on local television,
newspapers and some radio stations.
**Because of the Y.D.C.,
all three defendants from the
November police riot have
had their charges dropped or
reduced to a minor misdemeanor.
In March, the State
Legislature dropped its proposed
curfew law on a
technicality. Their motives
are clear: drop the issue now
and the movement may
subside.**

But the Y.D.C. understands
that it was a tactical move and
they'll be back again with full
force.

This Y.D.C. victory will not
serve to subdue the movement
but to organize it. When we
organize, particularly with labor,
the bosses and the state can be
forced back. From this victory we
must build the Y.D.C. forces
strengthening the ranks through
raising the political level of the
membership and then go on the
offensive. We must support all
picket lines, fight two-tier contracts,
mobilize against the city
council's anti-youth legislation,
help in union drives, particularly
helping to unionize and raise
the living standards of youth and fight racism.

If the Y.D.C. builds on its success,
if other Y.D.C.s spring up
in other cities (as they have
already in Vancouver and
Portland), if we continue to
orientate our work to the mighty
trade union movement, youth
can then play their most vital
role in the working class movement. We can provide the
energy, the enthusiasm and the
spirit to go on the attack to defend our rights and fight for a
socialist U.S.A. and socialist world.&nbsp;❧
