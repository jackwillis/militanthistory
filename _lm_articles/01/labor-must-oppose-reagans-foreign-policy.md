The Reagan Administration attacks wages,
conditions and social programs at home on
behalf of the major corporations -- big
business -- which demand higher profits at
the expense of the working and middle
classes. Its foreign policy is also dictated by
these same corporations and their need to
preserve their profits, markets, sources of raw
materials and power abroad.

{% include drop-cap.html text="The economic system" %}
of big business, which is capitalism
and landlordism, has brought increased
poverty and starvation
to the majority of the people of
the under-developed countries of
the world. As a result, wave after
wave of revolution unfolds as the
working class and peasants of these countries fight to change their societies in order to live.

Inevitably, these revolts challenge the wealth and power of big business.
U.S. governments have historically intervened to defeat these revolutions.
The war in Southeast Asia in the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s was an example of this.
This war resulted in the first military defeat of the United States.

This defeat came about
because the Vietnamese workers
and peasants saw that victory for
the Viet Cong, irrespective of the
lack of workers' democracy that
would accompany such victory,
would take the weight of
capitalism and landlordism off
their back. A secret congressional
report in 1967 explained
the "high morale" of the opposition
forces. It stated, "The Viet Cong
have eliminated the
landlords and reallocated
lands... to the landless...."

The defeat in Southeast Asia
in 1975 led to a mood of isolationism
in the U.S. The majority
of Americans wanted no
repeat of the suffering and
trauma of the Vietnam war. This
weakened the ability of U.S. big
business to defend its interests
abroad as it depends on working-class
Americans to do its fighting
for it.

### Colonial revolution

The revolt of the starving
peoples of the former colonial
countries continued.
In Nicaragua, the U.S. backed dictator, Somoza, was overthrown
and replaced by the Sandinistas
who initally declared their
solidarity with the Cuban revolution, their opposition to U.S. big business,
and favor towards revolution in all of Central America.

The colonial revolution was
now a sharp reality in U.S. big
business's own backyard. Reagan
mined Nicaragua's harbors, enforced
economic sanctions and armed the thugs of the deposed dictator Somoza,
the Contras, whom he then called "freedom fighters"
and set up bases in Honduras to attack Nicaragua.

Faced with continued and rising
revolts in Asia, Africa and
Latin America, U.S. big business
through Reagan continued its efforts
to turn around the mood at
home to enable it to intervene
more effectively abroad. It held
up the threat of "Soviet military
superiority" and stepped up
arms spending. It blamed the
Soviet bureaucracy for the
revolts in the former colonial
countries and increasingly
prepared the mood of the U.S.
people for new foreign wars.

The Soviet bureaucracy seeks
to come to an agreement with
U.S. imperialism (big business)
to divide up the world between
them into spheres of influence.
They do not seek to stir up new
revolutions as these increase
world instability and increase
the risk of their own working
class overthrowing them
and establishing workers'
democracies. Reagan in his major
foreign policy speech on
March 14 quoted Gorbachev as
saying "...the Soviet Union required
international calm to deal
with its internal problems."

The colonial revolutions arise
out of the crisis of capitalism and
landlordism. They do not result
from the promptings of the
Soviet bureaucracy in spite of
what Reagan says, and in spite
of the attempts by the Soviet
bureaucracy to get the rising
forces of the colonial revolution
into its camp and to use this in
its negotiations with U.S.
imperialism.

### Terror groups

As well as using the "threat of
Soviet expansionism" the
Reagan administration has
taken every opportunity to exploit
to the full the lunatic actions of the individual terror
groups who bomb civilian aircraft, spray airport lounges with
machine guns and kill American tourists. These activities strengthen Reagan and
American big business by helping to confuse the U.S. working
and middle class and create a
new mood: "We cannot let them
push us around like that and do
nothing." This is a comment increasingly heard.

The strategy of U.S. big
business to more aggressively defend its interests abroad was
moved up into higher gear in the
last days of March. The U.S. Navy assembled its largest force
since World War II and sailed into the Gulf of Sidra which is
claimed as Libyan waters by Libyan
leader Gaddafi. Given the
past activities of Gaddafi, and
his use of anti-U.S. rhetoric to
keep his hold on power, it was
certain he would take some actions.
The U.S. government
deliberately provoked this by
their aggression, and than sank
Libyan ships and bombed Libyan
bases.

Backed by the media, Reagan
successfully associated Gaddafi
with the individual terror
groups with whom he undoubtedly has links and won the
support of the majority of
Americans once again for U.S.
military actions abroad. The
other effect of his actions was to
strenghten Gaddafi.

Big business considered this a
price worth paying as the real
object of the operation was not in
the Mediteranean but in Central
America. Simultaneously with
his aggressive Libyan actions,
Reagan pulled Nicaragua onto
center stage. He portrayed a "hot
pursuit" action of the Sandinistas against the
<abbr>CIA</abbr>-organized Contras as "a major threat to
Honduran sovereignty."

Reagan then pressed $20
million of U.S. aid on the Honduran government and insisted
they send troops to the border area with Nicaragua where the Contras were based.
And in a major escalation of American involvement, he provided U.S. helicopters and pilots to fly in these troops.

At the same time, he threw his opponents in Congress who opposed his $100 million aid to the Contras onto the defensive.
The Senate then proceeded to back
his package, and no doubt the
Democrats who control the
House after their ritualistic
posturing will now also approve
money for the Contras.

### Sandinistas

U.S. imperialism is absolutely
committed to overthrowing the
Sandinistas in spite of the Sandinistas'
move to the right, its increased repression of unions and
the right to strike, and its continued support for 60% of the
economy remaining in private
hands. Their determination is
because the Sandinistas came to
power through a revolution
which overthrew a U.S.-backed
dictator, dared to oppose U.S.
imperialism's policies and stooges
in the area and have survived
in the backyard of the U.S. itself.
It is therefore a beacon to all
forces in Latin America fighting
corrupt right-wing U.S.-backed
regimes.

A new Cuba in the area and
especially on the mainland of the
continent is not going to be
tolerated. When the Bishop
regime came to power in
Grenada, Reagan used a split that
developed in that regime to invade.
He is also committed to
overthrowing the Sandinistas.

It is now clear that the Contras
are unable to achieve this, so he
has dragged Honduran troops
onto the firing line. They will be
incapable of overthrowing the
Sandinistas in any war which
could be provoked between them.
At the same time as the U.S.
have pilots and helicopters flying
Honduran troops to the trouble
spots, they have 2,500 troops in
Honduras, and they have built
large airstrips capable of taking
large military supply aircraft.
Now, in a further stepping-up of
direct involvement the Reagan
Administration announced in
the first days of April that it was
going to send "advisors" to aid
the Contras.

### Military involvement

The most likely prospect now
is for increased involvement of
U.S. troops leading towards
large scale military involvement
and war in Central America.
This is not yet certain as
revolutionary events in Chile, Mexico
and throughout Latin America
could unfold with such power
that U.S. imperialism could be
forced to hold its hand.

This seems to be the only
development which can cut
across increasing U.S. military
involvement. The fact that a majority
of Americans still oppose
Reagan's Central American
policies can be overcome. The
<cite>New York Times</cite> recently
described the mood of the country
"as being in a transition to
an earlier mood -- pre-Vietnam."

The Gulf of Tonkin is now regularly mentioned in the U.S. Congress and press.
The U.S. government falsely claimed that U.S. forces had been attacked by North Vietnamese
in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964, and used this as an excuse to commit large numbers of troops to the war in Vietnam.
They can easily repeat such a fraud to change the mood at home.

They have set the stage for it
by putting U.S. pilots on the
Nicaraguan border. A U.S.
government official recently
stated, "I cannot promise you an
American won't be shot." And
the <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite> stated,
"One of the dangers here is that
in such an incursion (the Sandinistas pursuing the contras)
some American troops might get killed and this could be the event
that triggers a direct U.S. military involvement."

If U.S. troops do become involved
in a war in Central America,
they will become bogged down in
a drawn out conflict in the area
as a whole. They will be used to
fight and kill workers and
peasants in the area and to defend
the capitalists and landlords.

### U.S. labor

U.S labor must mobilize its
forces against all acts of U.S. big
business's aggression and to stop
a war developing in Central
America with the accompanying
slaughter of workers and
peasants of Latin America along
with the working class and youth
of the United States itself.

**Instead, U.S. labor must
the struggles of the working
class, youth, and especially
oppressed minorities in the
U.S. with the workers and
peasants of Central America
and Latin America as a
whole. They must wage a
common struggle against the
big corporations which constitute 
a dictatorship over the
U.S. and the entire continent
of Latin America.**&nbsp;❧
