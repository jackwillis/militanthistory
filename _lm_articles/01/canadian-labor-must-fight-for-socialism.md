10.6% of the Canadian workforce is at present
unemployed. 19% of 19 to 24 year-olds are jobless. 1 in 6
Canadians live in poverty and 1 in 25 are officially
classified as living in inadequate housing conditions.
The economic upswing of the past 3 years has passed
these working-class families by.

{% include drop-cap.html text="Economic developments in" %}
Canada cannot be viewed separately
from the US economy. Canadian
capitalism has historically been too
weak to stand up to the colossus
next door. 76% of Canada's foreign
trade is with the US and 7 out of
the 12 top Canadian companies are
US-owned. This domination by US
capitalism is increasing as Canadian
big business shows itself unwilling
to invest its profits into
Canadian manufacturing industry.

In 1985, more capital flowed out
of the country than came in.
Investment in 1985 was below the
level of the 1981--1982 recession.
Between 1974 and 1981 the book
value of Canadian investment in
the US quadrupled to C$27.4
billion and much of this went into
real estate. This failure to invest is
what lies at the heart of the
economic crisis in Canada.

### Upswing

The upswing of the past 3 years
resulted mainly from increased demand in
the US as the indebtedness of US consumers,
corporations, federal and state governments increased.
Canadian consumers also increased their
indebtedness and the deficit of the
Canadian federal and provincial
governments rose to 9% of the
<abbr>GNP</abbr>. This is now between 2 and 3
times the equivalent figure for the
US. The federal deficit alone accounts
for C$34 billion. The interest
on this is equal to 25% of all
federal spending, more than is
spent on pensions, health, education
and social assistance programs
combined.

The US economy has slowed
drastically from over 6% growth in
1984 to just over 2% in 1985. It can
no longer continue to pile up the
deficits that fueled the upswing.
The Canadian economy is also
reaching the limits of its borrowing
capacity. The fall in the price of oil
and raw materials further weakens
demand.

### Attacks

The attacks on workers' living
standards have continued
unabated over the past decade.
**Between 1978 and 1984 wage
increases were below inflation.** These
attacks as well as the rising
unemployment add to the
weakness in the economy. Canada
will accompany the US economy
into crisis in the coming 12 to 18
months.

As imports flood into the US
economy, the call for protectionism
gains strength. The Conservative
Government in Ottawa resting
primarily on finance capital and the
section of the capitalists in
Western Canada who are based on
oil, minerals and lumber have pushed
for a free trade agreement with
the US.

This has led to a split with the
manufacturing capitalists mainly
based in Ontario, **where 50% of all
Canadian-manufactured products
are produced, and Québec, where
25% are produced.** The Liberal Party
recently won control of the Provincial
Governments in Québec and
Ontario. The Conservative Government
has shown increasing indecisiveness
on the issue of free trade.

### Labor's power

This "Progressive" Conservative
Government was elected in 1984
with 50% of the vote and 211 seats
to 40 seats for the Liberals and 30
for the <abbr>NDP</abbr>. It is now a government
off crisis staggering from one
crisis and resignation to another.
**The main reason for this is the
power of the Canadian working
class.**

**39 million workers, 42% of the
employed workforce, is unionized.**
The Canadian workers have been
consistently in the top 3 to 4 of the
main capitalist countries in days
lost in strikes.

The partial general strike in
British Columbia in December,
1983, when 80,000 public sector
workers were on strike and about
to be followed out by the transport
workers, shows Canadian labor's
fighting capacity. This powerful
movement, which was the first of
its kind in the post-war period in
either the US or Canada, is a sign of
things to come.

This combativity is rising. In
1985, wages were forced above
prices for the first time in 7 years.
On top of this, the strikes for union
rights and recognition that have
been conducted in Eatons in Toronto
and in the Commerce Bank show
that sections of workers not traditionally
militant are now also taking action.

### Labor's program

Unfortunately, the labor leaders
have not put forward a program on
which labor can fight and solve its
problems. Their main fight is
against free trade. While it is correct
to oppose any deal between US
and Canadian capital,it is no alternative
to argue for the status quo
or more protectionism.

**Canadian labor should unite with
American workers in a fight-back
against the common bosses and
fight for an end to the dictatorship
of American and Canadian corporations
over all of North America and
for it to be replaced by a Socialist
United States of North America.**

### <abbr>NDP</abbr>

The strength of the working class
is also shown by the base of the
New Democratic Party -- the
Canadian labor party -- the traditional
political arm of the Canadian working
class which is based on the
unions. It won 20% of the vote in
the last Federal elections. At present,
it has a majority in the polls
in all the Western Provinces except
Alberta. And in an important new
breakthrough, its support in the polls in Québec has reached 19% as the
<span lang="fr-CA">Parti Québécois</span> has split.

The leaders of the <abbr>NDP</abbr> and organized labor must fight for an alternative to Canadian capitalism and its parties,
the (so-called) Progressive Conservatives, the Liberals, the Social Credits and the <span lang="fr-CA">Parti Québécois</span>.
**It must break all alliances with conservative parties such as it has in Ontario at present where it is propping up a minority liberal government.**

Fighting on a socialist program
and for a majority <abbr>NDP</abbr> government,
the support of the majority
of Canadian voters can be won and
unity forged. between French
speaking and English speaking
Canadian workers. This would not
only offer a way out for Canadian
workers but would provide a
beacon for US workers struggling
to make a decent life for themselves
and their families.

OPPOSE MULRONEY AND REAGAN.  
UNITY BETWEEN CANADIAN AND US LABOR.  
FOR A SOCIALIST UNITED STATES OF NORTH AMERICA.
