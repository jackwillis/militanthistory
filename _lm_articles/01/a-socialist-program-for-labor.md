The demands by employers for concessions are facing increasing opposition.
In the first five months of 1985, there were 18 strikes by more than 1,000 workers.
In the last five months of the year, this doubled to 36.

{% include drop-cap.html text="Cannery workers in" %}
Watsonville, California, print workers in
Chicago, and meatpackers in
Austin, Minnesota have been on
the picket lines for over six months.
They have been joined by workers
at General Electric and train and
bus workers in Massachusetts,
transit workers in Philadelphia, and
flight attendants at <abbr>TWA</abbr>.

The heroic resistance of the P-9
local in Austin has tapped a wide
layer of support among union
members. This reflects the rising
anger and bitterness of workers
who are looking for a lead to avenge
the cuts and attacks they have
been suffering. The strike of <abbr>TWA</abbr>
flight attendants shows that new
layers of workers not previously
considered militant are now entering the struggle.

**As workers see that concessions
only lead to demands for more concessions,
more and more of them are saying "enough is enough."**
The lesson is learned -- concessions do not work.
These five years of intense attacks on labor,
starting with the Chrysler deal in 1979
and continuing with the smashing of <abbr>PATCO</abbr>,
have spread through industry after industry.

### Concessions cause unemployment

In spite of the arguments of
employers and their press and politicians
the concessions wrested from labor since the Chrysler deal in 1979
have not saved jobs or solved the problems of the economy.
The opposite is the case. Concessions weaken the ability of workers
to buy back the goods they produce.

Cuts in the wages of <abbr>TWA</abbr>
workers reduce their ability to buy
an automobile. Cuts in the wages of
GM workers reduce their ability to
travel by plane.
**One worker's wage cut is another worker's job loss.**

The bosses say that workers are
pricing themselves out of jobs
because their wages are too high.
There was a bigger difference between
the wages of U.S. workers
and the wages of workers overseas in the 1950s and 1960s than there is today.
If the high wages of U.S. workers are the cause of the crisis,
then why didn't the crisis happen in the 1950s and 1960s rather than now?

In 1980, U.S. workers were in first place! Reagan's policies had
increased the value of the dollar by over 40% over this period,
and so raised the price of U.S. labor relative to labor in other countries.

<cite>Business Week</cite>, one of the serious journals of big business, explained it clearly in June 1982.
"Labor costs are not the sole or even the important cause of the decline in steel, autos and rubber industry."

### Investment

The main reason for the crisis in
the U.S. economy is the low level of
investment by big business in new
industrial plant and industrial
capacity in the U.S. compared to its rivals.
**In the 25 years of the post-war boom
of capitalism between 1950 and 1975, Japan invested 30%
of its gross national products
(<abbr>GNP</abbr>) back into production. In the
U.S. the figure was only 14%.**
U.S. employers were squandering their profits in arms production,
speculation, and the service sector.
This left increasingly old and obsolete plants and equipment in the U.S.
which was less able to compete with the modernized plants of its foreign rivals.

### Setbacks

The failure of the labor leaders to
answer the arguments of the
bosses on concessions has led them
in many cases to support the
policies of concessions. As a result,
labor has suffered setbacks over
the past five to six years and been
thrown onto the defensive.

The effects of this can be seen in the <abbr>TWA</abbr> strike, where flight attendants
were willing to take a 15% cut in wages in an attempt to protect their jobs.
The employers demanded a 17% cut in pay, and overall cuts in the region of 44%.
In this strike, if these workers can gain a settlement with only a 15% cut they will consider it a victory!
Even five years ago, this 15% would have
seemed a major defeat and an insult by these workers.

Out of these attacks, workers are
beginning to learn harsh and painful
lessons about life in America in
the 1980s. Karen Lantz, vice president
of the Independent Federation
of Flight Attendants, described the
changes in attitude of <abbr>TWA</abbr>
workers during the strike: "**The
membership have probably learned
more in the last two weeks than in
the last 20 years**." Bitter and often
isolated battles are breaking out
leading to a hardening of a layer of
workers. Also, new, more militant
leaders are being thrown up in a
number of locals, like at P-9 in
Austin.

### Counter-offensive

The mood of bitterness and anger
that is building among workers will
at some stage lead to a major
counter-offensive. All the traditions
of militancy and struggle of
American labor in the 1930s will
re-emerge in the new movement.
The great victories of the <abbr>CIO</abbr> in
the 1930s themselves came out of
the setbacks of the early 1930s.

The benefits labor has today were
only won by the dynamic and
explosive <abbr>CIO</abbr> movement of the
1930s. Mass picketing, open confrontation
with scabs, mass industrial unions,
and the sit-down strikes were needed to turn the tide
in the 1930s. It is these tactics and
traditions, a glimpse of which can
be seen in the determined struggle
by Hormel workers in Austin, that
are necessary to win gains in this
period of crisis of capitalism.

### The unorganized

A movement of even larger proportions
to that of the 1930s will
develop in the future. This will
engulf the millions of unorganized
workers in the service industries,
fast-food restaurants, sweat shops,
small manufacturing plants and offices.
Unions will sweep these
workforces in a similar way to how
the <abbr>CIO</abbr> took industry by storm in
the period of 1936 and 1937. From
18% of the workforce organized today,
it is likely to see 40%, 50% or
even 60% organized in unions as
has been achieved by workers in
some countries of Europe.

### Protectionism

Rather than prepare the movement
for this fightback the labor
leaders look for other alternatives.
One of these is the demand for protectionism,
or tariff barriers. They
argue that by stopping foreign
goods entering the U.S. markets,
jobs of U.S. workers can be protected.
However, what these
arguments fail to take into account
is that any protectionist measures
taken by the U.S. would meet with
retaliation from its rivals abroad.
With one in six jobs in the U.S. now
dependent on exports, this would
mean layoffs for these workers.
These workers would then be
unable to buy the goods produced
by workers for the home market
and their jobs would also be lost.

Not only would protectionism fail
to solve the crisis, but it would
makeit worse. This “solution” was
tried before. **The Smoot--Hawley
Act of 1930 increased tariff barriers.
Agricultural exports fell
from $200 million in 1922 to only $5
million in 1932. Auto exports fell
from $541 million in 1929 to 76
million in 1932. Similar declines occurred
in other industries. By 1933,
a wage cut averaging 45% had been
implemented through all of industry
and there were 12 to 17 million
unemployed.** This would be
equivalent to 30 million workers
unemployed today.

### Labor's program

The Labor leaders must put forward
a program that can defend
wages and protect jobs and
mobilize the power of labor.
Companies who demand concessions
must be met with the demand:
"Open the books." This means all
the financial records of the company,
including those of interlocking
companies and banks.

Those companies who can pay decent
wages and benefits must be
forced to pay up. Those companies
which are in difficulty must be
taken out of the hands of their
owners and nationalized under
democratic workers' control and
management. Their owners have
proved they are unfit to run them.

This must be linked to the struggle
for a public works program to
build houses, hospitals, schools,
recreational facilities and the
crumbling infrastructure. The
working week for all must be reduced
to 32 hours with no loss of pay
and a national minimum wage of at
least $10 per hour established. All
working people must have the right
to 32 hours work or 32 hours pay.

### 500 corporations

This is the program which can
meet the needs of American
workers and throw the concession
period into reverse. The wealth in
U.S. society makes its implementation
entirely possible. **What is
necessary is that control and
ownership of this wealth is taken
out of the hands of the top 500
privately-owned corporations
which constitute a dictatorship
over U.S. society. These must be
nationalized under workers control
and management and a socialist
plan of production implemented.**

### Labor party

Labor needs its own political party
to implement such a program. It
cannot rely on the Democrats and
Republicans to look after its
interests. Both parties are parties of
big business, and will side with big
business on all the essential issues.
A labor party based on the trade
unions can provide a solution to the
horrors of a crisis-ridden capitalism
and the devastation of people's
lives, hopes, and expectations.

The energy of the American people
could then be channelled to
building a society where the needs
of the majority of the population
would be cared for. It is only then
that the horrors of unemployment,
low wages, fear of illness and accident,
bad housing and poverty
could be ended, and the idea of the
"American Dream" could become a
reality.&nbsp;❧
