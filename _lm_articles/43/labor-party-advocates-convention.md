Labor Party Advocates (<abbr>LPA</abbr>) has
announced June 1996 as the time of its
founding convention. The building of a
labor party, which is the goal of <abbr>LPA</abbr>,
would be a historic event for US workers
and the international labor movement.
During the next nine months it is essential
that as broad a layer of workers as
possible get involved in <abbr>LPA</abbr> to ensure
that the needs of workers are presented
at the convention.

two parties been
held in such disrepute. In opinion polls,
a majority of the public has continually
supported the building of a new
party. Also, an overwhelming majority
cannot name a single politician they
admire. Never has the opportunity
been better for creating a massive
political party for workers, i.e. a labor party.

We can not allow any time to go by.
There are many forces, like Perot, who
will seek to tap the discontent of workers,
to channel it behind false promises
and destructive policies. It essential
that a Labor Party is formed to present
a real class alternative for workers
in 1996 elections.

Over the last couple of years the
leadership of <abbr>LPA</abbr> has been arguing
that <abbr>LPA</abbr> must not support candidates
and had no program. Now, the leadership
argues that the program and
other issues will be decided at the convention.
Many <abbr>LPA</abbr> activists were
expecting the convention to be held in
the fall of 1995, not the June 1996 date
that has been announced.

It was in this spirit that the Seattle
chapter of <abbr>LPA</abbr> has twice contacted
the national <abbr>LPA</abbr> leadership to urge
the convention date be brought forward
to the end of January at the latest.
It argued that the June date
“would almost eliminate the possibility
of us being able to contest the 1996
elections at the local and national
level, including for President of the
United States,” and that: “By calling a
convention at this later date, they [the
<abbr>LPA</abbr> Leadership] are in effect pre-empting
the conference on this vital
question.” It is important that <abbr>LPA</abbr>
members and chapters also contact
the leadership on this important issue.

In the meantime, it is essential that
<abbr>LPA</abbr> develops a campaigning approach
to building support for a labor party.
Local chapters are a good start. In
Seattle, we are organizing for a rally on
October 7. We are planning a dual
campaign both inside the local labor
movement, but also to have tables at
public events and give out fliers to
reach the general public. The chapter
has stressed the need to involve workers
from all backgrounds, especially
non-union workers who face the worst
conditions and have the most to gain
from a labor party.

During the next period the
Democrats can be expected to reach
out to labor to strangle it, so that it
does not have a voice to organize the
discontent and anger of workers and
youth. We have to raise our voices and
say that “We have seen enough of the
Democrats!” Build a labor party! Get
involved in <abbr>LPA</abbr>! For Labor candidates
to fight the candidates of the bosses in
1996!
