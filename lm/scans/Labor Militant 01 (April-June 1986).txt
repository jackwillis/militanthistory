FOR LABOR AND YOUTH — WORKING CLASS UNITY AND SOCIALISM

END DICTATORSHIP
OF BIG BUSINESS
Exactly one. hundred years ago, the U.S.
working class took up one of the most

ferocious battles of its entire history — the battle for the eight-hour day: May 1, now
celebrated by workers round the world, was

markedin 1886 by general strikes in almost

every major city of the U.S. as tens of

thousands of workers struck for a shorter
work week with noless pay.
Today,

similar battles

are

brewing once again as the wages
and conditions of workers are
coming under vigorous assault.
First-year raises in union contracts have plummeted from
about 10% in’the early 70’s to
2.4% in 1984. Real wages have
dropped by 14% from 1972 to
1984. The numberof“two-tier”
contracts almost doubled in
1984, hitting hardest at the
younger workers just entering
the workforce.
From cradle to grave, poverty
is now a wayoflife for many.
Some 20 million Americans go
hungry atleast part of the time,
onein four children under6 live
in poverty, andhalf of all black
children live in poverty. Over
12% of the aged, whose only
crime was to have worked hard
all their lives, are’now in pover-

ty too.

Perhaps the contradictions are
best summarized by theplight of
90,000 farmers in the U.S. who
are threatened with ruin and
can't sell their produce due to the
glut of grain on the world market

while millions go hungry in
every corner ofthe globe!
WORKING CLASS
But today the workingclass is
stronger than ever before and
will not give up the gains it has
made in the past 50 years
without major struggles. The
last year has seen general
strikes in Bolivia, Denmark,
Greece and Spain, the 12 month

cold miners’ strike in Britain,
and the magnificant movement
of the masses of black workers
and youth of South Africa.
The U.S. working class is now
also starting to take action. The
strikes of the cannery workers in
Watsonville,

CA,

and

‘the

Hormel workers of Austin, MN,
show that opposition to concessions is increasing. In its
preparation for the huge tasks
ahead, rank and file union
members are beginning to
develop anew, fighting
leadership.
The U.S. working class will
return once again to the traditions of the 1930's. The trade
unions will be transformed into

fighting democratic organizations, and in the process the de-

mand will be raised to break
with the politicians of big
business. The most powerful
working class in the capitalist
world will demandthat it have
its own political party — a labor
party, based on the unions.
Thiswill coincide with the rising tide of the working class
movement internationally —
both East and West. However,

the U.S. Labor Party will have

to deal with the growingcrisis of
the world capitalist system.
Throughthis struggle, through
victories and defeats, times of
turbulence andlulls, tremendous
lessons will be learned. It will

FOREIGN POLICY
’
“” By Robert O Neill

The Reagan Administration attacks wages,
conditions and social programs at home on
behalf of the major corporations — big
business — which demandhigherprofits at
the expense of the working and middle
classes. Its foreign policy is also dictated by
these same corporations and their need to
preservetheir profits, markets, sources of raw
materials and power abroad.
The economic system of big
business, which is capitalism

and landlordism, has brought increased poverty and starvation

to the majority of the people of
the underdevelopedcountries of
the world. As a result, waveafter
waveofrevolution unfolds as the

This defeat came about
because the Vietnamese workers

the Vietcong,irrespective of the
lack of workers democracy that
would accompanysuch victory,
would take the weight of
capitalism and landlordism off
their back. A secret congressional report in 1967 explained
the “high morale” of the opposition forces.It stated, “The Vietcong have eliminaed the

dictator Somoza, the contras,
who he then called “freedom

Hondurasto attack Nicaragua.
Faced with continued andrising revolts in Asia, Africa and
Latin America, U.S.big business
through Reagan continued its efforts to turn around the mood at
hometo enable it to intervene
more effectively abroad. It held
up the threatof “Soviet military
superiority” and stepped up
arms spending. It blamed the
Soviet bureaucracy for the
revolts in the former colonial
countries and increasingly
prepared the mood of the U.S.
people for new foreign wars.

The Soviet bureaucracy seeks

to come to an agreement with
U.S. imperialism (big business)

democracies. Reagan in his major foreign policy speech on
March 14 quoted Gorbachov as
saying “...the Soviet Union required international calm to deal
with its internal problems.”
The colonial revolutions arise
outof thecrisis of capitalism and
landlordism. They do not result
from the promptings of the
Soviet bureaucracy in spite of
what Reagan says, and in spite
of the attempts by the Soviet
bureaucracy to get the rising

forces of the colonial revolution
into its camp andto use this in
its negotiations with U.S.
imperialism.
.
TERROR GROUPS
As well as using the “threat of
Soviet expansionism’ the
Reagan administration has
taken every opportunity to exploit to the full the lunatic actions of the individual terror
groups who bombcivilian aircraft, spray airport lounges with
machine guns and kill American
tourists. These activities

since World WarII andsailed into the Gulf of Sidra which is
claimed as Lybian waters byLy-

bian leader Ghaddaffi. Given the
past activities of Ghaddaffi and
his use of anti-U.S. rhetoric to
keep his hold on power it was
certain he would take some actions. The U.S. government
deliberately provoked this by
their aggression, and than sank
Lybian ships and bombed Lybian
bases.
Backed by the media, Reagan

successfully associated Ghaddaffi with the individual terror
groups with whom he undoubtedly has links and won the
support of the majority of
Americans once again for U.S.
military actions abroad. The
othereffect of his actions was to
strenghten Ghaddaffi.
Big business considered this a
price worth paying as the realobject of the operation was not in
the Mediteranean but in Central
America. Simultaneously with

his aggressive Lybian actions,

Reagan pulled Nicaragua onto
centerstage. He portrayed a “hot
pursuit” action of the Sandinistas against the CIA organized contras as “a major threat to
Honduran sovereignty.”
Reagan then pressed $20
million of U.S. aid on the Honduran governmentandinsisted
new mood, “Wecannotlet them

Senate then proceeded to back
his package, and no doubt the
Democrats who control the
House after their ritualistic
posturing will now also approve
moneyfor the contras.

SANDINISTAS
U.S. imperialism is absolutely
committed to overthrowing the
Sandinistas in spite of the Sandinistas’ moveto the right,its increased repression of unions and
the right to strike, and its continued support for 60% of the
economy remaining in private

hands. Their determination is
because the Sandinistas came to
power through a revolution
which overthrew a U..S. backed
dictator, dared to oppose U.S.imperialism’s policies and stooges
in the area and have survived
in the backyard ofthe U.S.itself.
It is therefore a beacon to all
forces in Latin America fighting
corrupt right wing U.S. backed
regimes.

A new Cubain the area and
especially on the mainland of the
continent is not going to be
tolerated. When the Bishop
regime came to power in
Grenada, Regan used split that

overthrowing the Sandinistas.
It is now clear that the contras
are unableto achievethis, so he
has dragged Honduran troops
onto thefiring line. They will be
incapable of overthrowing the
Sandinistas in any war which
could be provoked between them.
At the same time as the U.S.

The d

is that any protectionist measures
taken by the U.S, would meet with
retaliation from its rivals abroad.
With onein six jobs in the U.S. now

mean lay-offs for these workers.

These workers would then , be

unable to buy the goods produced
by workers for the home market
and their jobs wouldalso be lost.
Not only would protectionismfail
to solve the crisis, but it would
makeit worse. This “solution” was
tried before. The Smoot-Hawley
Act of 1930 increased tariff barriers. Agricultural exports fell
from $200 million in 1922 to ony $5
million in 1932. Auto exports fell

The main reason for the crisis in

investment by big business in new

capacity in the U.S. compared to its
rivals. In the 25 years of the postwar boom of capitalism between
1950 and 1975 Japan invested 30%

cut in wages in an attempt to protect their jobs. The employers
demanded @ 17% cut in pay, and
overall cuts in the region of 44%. In

this strike if these workers can gain
a settlement with only a 15% cut
they will consider it a victory! Even
five years ago this 15% would have
seemed a major defeat and an insult by these workers.

Outof these attacks, workers are

beginning to learn harsh and painful lessons aboutlife in America in

the 1980’s. Karen Lantz,vice presi-

dentof the Independent Federation
of Flight Attendants, described the
changes in attitude of TWA
workers during strike: ‘‘The
hnealin iP have probably learned
more in the last two weeks than in
the last 20 years”. Bitter and often

isolated battles are breaking out

leading to a hardening of a layer of
workers. Also, new more militant
leaders are being thrown up in a

number of locals, like at P-9 in
Austin.

Counter-offensive

The mood ofbitterness and anger
thatis building among workers will

at some stage lead to a major

counter-offensive. All the tradi-

tions of militancy and struggle of
American labor in the 1930's will
re-emerge in the new movement.
The great victories of the CIO in
the 1930’s themselves cameout of

the set-backs of the early 1930's.
The benefits lal
today

weré only won by the dynamic and
explosive CIO movement of the
1930's. Mass picketing, open confrontation with scabs mass in-

dustrial unions, and the sit-down
strikes were needed to turn the tide

in the 1930's.It is these tactics and

traditions, a glimpse of which can
be seen in the determined struggle

by Hormel workers in Austin, that
are necessary to win gains in this

period ofcrisis of capitalism.

The Unorganized
A movementof even larger proportions to that of the 1930's will
develop in the future. This will
engulf the millions of unorganized
workers in the service industries,
fast-food restaurants, sweat shops,
small manufacturing plants and offices. Unions will sweep these
workforces in a similar way to how

the CIO took industry by storm in
the period of 1936 and 1937. From

18% of the workforce organized today,it is likely to see 40%, 50% or

even 60% organized in unions as

has been achieved by workers in
somecountries of Europe.
tectionism
Rather than prepare the move-

ment for this fightback the labor
leaders look for other alternatives.
Oneof these is the demandfor pro-

Honduran troops to the trouble

large airstrips capableof taking
large military supply aircraft.
Now,in a further stepping up of
direct involvement the Reagan
Administration announced in
thefirst days of April that it was
going to send “advisors” to aid
the contras.
MILITARY INVOLVEMENT
The most likely prospect now
is for increased involvementof

U.S. troops leading towards
large scale military involvement
and war in Central America.
This is not yet certain as revolutionary events in Chile, Mexico
and throughout Latin America
could unfold with such power
that U.S. imperialism could be
forced to hold its hand.
This seems to be the only
development which can cut
across increasing U.S. military
involvement. The fact that a majority of Americans still oppose
Reagan’s Central American
policies can be overcome. The
New York Times recently

described the mood of the coun-

try “as being in a transition to

tectionism, or tariff barriers. They
argue that by stopping foreign
goods entering the U.S. markets,

a wage cut averaging 45% had been
implemented through all of industry and there were 12-17 million
unemployed. This would be
equivalent to 30 ‘million workers
unemployed today.
Labor’s Program
The Labor leaders must put forward a program that can defend
wages and protect jobs and

mobilize the power of labor. Com-

panies who demand concessions
must be met with the demand:
“Open the books”. This means all

the financial records of the com-

pany,including those of interlocking companies and banks.

Those companies who can pay\de-

cent wages and benefits must be

forced to pay up. Those companies

which are in difficulty miust be

taken out of the hands of their
owners and nationalized under
democratic workers control and

management. Their owners have
proved they are unfit to run them.
This mustbe linked to the struggle for a public works program to
build houses, hospitals, schools,
recreational facilities and the
crumbling infrastructure. The
working week for all must be reduced to 32 hours with no loss of pay
and a national minimum wage of at
least $10 per hour established. All
working people must havethe right
to 32 hours work or 32 hours pay.
500 Corporations
This is the program which can
Meet the needs of American
workers and throw the concession

period into reverse. The wealth in

U.S.society makes its implementation entirely possible. What is
necessary is that control and
ownership of this wealth is taken
out of the hands of the top 500
privately owned corporations
which constitute a dictatorship
over U.S. society. These must be
nationalized under workers control
and management and a socialist
plan of production implemented.
Labor Party

Laborneeds its own political par-

ty to implement such a program.It
cannot rely on the Democrats and
Republicans to look after its inserests. Both parties are parties of
big, business, and will side with big
businessonall the essential issues.
A labor party based on the trade

unionscanprovide a solution to the

horrors ofa crisis ridden capitalism
and the devastation of people's
lives, hopes and expectations.
The energyof the American people could then be channelled to
building a society where the needs
of the majority of the population
would be cared for. It is only then
that the horrors of unemployment,
low wages, fear ofillness and accident, bad housing and poverty
could be ended, and the idea of the
“American Dream" could becom¢ a
reality.

a war developing in Central
America with the accompanying
slaughter’ of workers and
peasants of Latin America along
with the working class and youth
of the United States itself.
Instead, U.S. labor must link
the struggles of the working
class, youth, and especially
oppressed minorities in the
U.S. with the workers and
peasants of Central America
and Latin America ,js @
whole. They must wage 2
commonstruggle against the
big corporations which constitute a dictatorship over the

Life for the majority of black

a nightmare which has not gone unchallenged. The most heroic of the
black revolts of this century took
place in the 1950's and 1960's.
Malcom X called it the “Black
Revolution." It shook whitecapitalist dominated America to its

This black revolt merged with the
revolt of the army in Vietnam, the

new unions and gained experience

in organizing. This raised the expectationsandtheability to struggle of the black people as a whole.

The elemental movement of the

“Black Revolution,” drawing with it
sections of the white youth, won
some victories in the area of civil
rights, voting rights and racial
segregation. These were institutionalized in the Voting Rights and
Civil Rights acts of the early 1960's

Black leaders were murdered,

promises were made for more spending in the cities and the quota
system Mnown as Affirmative Action was introduced. Quotas of
minorities in employment were to

lawyers and the courts. These

combined with other factors and

was removed from the streets to

Camouflage
The quota system helped a tiny
minority of mainly middle class
blacks. Their gains were used to
camouflage the fall in living standards of the majority.
Between 1972 and 1982 the
number of black managers and officials rose by 83% to 445,000. The
percentage of blacks earning
$35,000 per year rose from 5.3% in

CANADIAN LABORMUST
FIGHT FOR SOCIALISM
By A Canadian
Correspondant

10.6% of the Canadian workforce is at present
unemployed. 19% Of°19-24 yea-olds are jobless. 1 in 6
Canadianslive in poverty and 1 in 25 areofficially
classified as living in inadequate housing conditions.
The economic upswing of the past 3 years has passed
these working class families by.
Economic developments in
Canada cannot be viewed separately from the US economy. Canadian
capitalism hashistorically been too
weak to stand up
the colossus
next door. 76% of
da’s foreign
trade is with the US and 7 out of

the 12 top Canadian companies are

US owned. This domination by US
capitalism is increasing as Canadian big business showsitself unilling
to invest its profits into
Canadian manufacturing industry.
In 1985, more capital flowed out
of the country than camein. Investment in 1985 was below the
level of the 1981-1982 recession.
Between 1974 and 1981 the book

value of Canadian investment in
the US quadrupled to C$27.4
billion and much of this went into

real estate. This failure to investis
what lies at the heart of the
economic crisis in Canada.
Upswing
The upswing of the past 3 years
resulted mainly from increased demand in, the US as the indebtedness of US consumers, corporations,federal and state governments increased. Canadian consumers also increased their indebtedness and the deficit of the
Canadian federal and provincial
governments rose to 9% of the
GNP.This is now between 2 and 3
times the equivalentfigure for the
US. The federal deficit alone accounts for C$34 billion. The interest on this is equal to 25% of all
federal spending, more than is
spent on pensions, health, education and social assistance programs
combined.
The US economy has slowed
drastically from over 6% growth in
1984 to just over 2% in 1985. It can
no longer continue to pile up the
deficits that fueled the upswing.
The Canadian economy is also
reaching thelimits of its borrowing
capacity. The fall in the price ofoil

and raw materials further weakens
demand.

Attacks

.

The attacks on workers’ living
standards have continued
unabated over the past decade.
Between 1978 and 1984 wage increases were below inflation. These
attacks as well as the rising
unemployment add to the
weakness in the economy. Canada
will accompany the US economyinto ctisis in the coming 12 to 18
months.
As, imports flood into the US

economy, the call for protectionism

strength. The Conservative
Government in Ottawa resting
primarily on finance capital and the
section of the capitalists in

Western Canada whoare based on
oil, minerals and lumber have push-

ed for a free trade agreement with

the US.

This has led to a split with the
manufacturing capitalists mainly
based in Ontario, where 50% ofall
Canadian manufactured products
are produced and Quebec, where
25% are produced. The Liberal Party recently won control of the Provincial Governments in Quebec and

OntarioThe Conservative Govern-

ment has shown increasing indecisiveness on the issue of free
trade.
fs
Labor's Power
This “Progressive” Conservative
Government was elected in 1984

with 50% of the vote and 211 seats

to 40 seats for the Liberals and 30
for the NDP. It is now a governt

mentof crisis staggering from one
crisis and resignation to another.
The main reason for this is the
power of the Canadian working
class.

39 million workers, 42% of the

employed workforce, is unionized.
The Canadian workers have been
consistently in the top 3 to 4 of the
main ‘capitalist countries in days
lost in strikes.
The partial general-strike in
British Columbia in December,
1983, when 80,000 public sector
workers were on strike and about
to be followed out by the transport

workers, shows Canadian labor's

fighting capacity. This powerful
movement, which was the first of
its kind in the post-war period in
éither the USor Canada,is a sign of
things to come.
This combativity is rising. In
1985, wages were forced above
prices for the first time in 7 years.
Ontopofthis, the strikes for union
rights and recognition that have
been conducted in Eatons in Toron-

to and in the Commerce Bank show
that sections of workersnot tradi-

tionally militant are now also tak-™
ing action.
Labor's Program
Unfortunately, the labor leaders
have not put forward a program on
which labor can fight and solve its
problems. Their main fight is
against free trade. While it is correct to oppose any deal between US
and Canadiancapital,it is no alternative to argue for the status quo
or more protectionism.
Canadianlabor should unite with
American workers in a fight back
against the common bosses and

fight for an end to the dictatorship

of American and Canadian corporations overall of North America and
for it to be replaced by a Sociali

The strength of the working class
is also shown by the base of the
New Democratic Party — the Canadian labor party — the traditional
political arm of the Canadian working class which is based on the
unions. It won 20% of the vote in

The movement of the working class and
peasants which removed Duvalier in Haiti
and Marcosin the Philippines reflects theferment which exists in the underdeveloped
countries of the world. General strikes, ar-

tial general strikes, food riots and massive

demonstrations are commonplaceas revolutionary developments assume regional and

even continental proportions.
Thecrisis in the Phillipines is
accompanied by the crisis in
South Korea, Malasia, Taiwan,
Indonesia and Thailand. The
crisis in Haiti is part ofthe movementof workers and peasants in
all of the Latin American Continent. This developing revolution
has resulted in the ending of 9
dictatorships in the continent
over the past 7 years. Regimes
which appeared unshakeable
have had to give way to the
powerof the mass movements.In
Bolivia alone there were 12
general strikes in 1985.
The most powerful country in
Africa is facing the greatest

revolt in its history. The black

youth and workers are moving

against apartheid andcapitalism
in South Africa. In Sudan a
general strike overthrew the
Nemeiri regime and riots have
rocked Egypt, Tunisia, and
Morocco.
The advanced capitalist
countries are also entering a
period ofcrisis and upheaval.
The decades of economic growth,

rising living standards and
relative peace between the working class and big business, which
were the experience during the
post war boom, are now over.
Partial general strikes or one

day general strikes have taken

place in Greece, Italy, Spain,

France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, and in

British Columbia and Newfoundland in Canada over the

past 3 years. These have beenac-

companied by the miners’ strike
in Britain and the IG Metal
strike for the 35 hour week in W.
Germany.
At the sametimeleft Governments have been elected with
outright majorities in France,
Greece and Spain. This was the
first time in the history of these
countries that there were majorities for the left. The left par-

ties in Belgium, the Netherlands

and W. Germanyare at present
at new highs in the opinionpolls
and the Swedish Social Democrats recently won re-election.
In the deformed workers’
states of Eastern Europe,
Russia and China a newcrisis
is also developing. The revolution in Poland in 1980 and 1981
showed the opposition of the
working class in these areas to

the mismanagement,corruption,

privileges and repression of the
dictatorial caste which rules
these countries.
Economic Crisis
Forthefirst time in history the
3 sectors of the world — the advanced capitalist countries, the
ex-colonial or underdeveloped
countries of the capitalist world
andthe Stalinist countries — are
simultaneously in crisis. At the
heart ofthiscrisisis the crisis of
the productive forces and the
slowing up in the rate of growth
in these forees and in the production of goods and services.
Between 1960 and 1973, the
Gross Domestic Product (GPD)of
the advanced capitalist countries
rose by 5% per year. During the
years 1973 to 1975 this fell to
1.7% peryear. For a brief period
of four years from 1975 to 1979
the figure rose.to.4,3%but from
1979 to 1981if*was once again
down to 1.8% per year.

By Victor Bloch

In the countries of COMECON,
which is made up predominantly of Eastern Europe and Russia,

average growth was 10% in the
1950s. This fell to 7% in the
1960's, 5% in the 1970's and in
1979 was 2.1% accordingto official figures.
While the populations have increased, the rate of growth in

production has slowed up. As a
result, the necessitiesoflife can
no longer be provided to the extent that was the case in the
years of the post-war boom.
The economic crisis in the
capitalist world is rooted in the
private ownership of the means

of production, distribution and

exchange andin the existence of
nation states. Big business can-

not overcome these contradictions so there is the development
of over-production and overcapacity. At present the
economics of the West operate at
only 80% of capacity in booms,
and 70% in slumps.This results
in plant closures and increased
unemployment and poverty, At
the same time protectionism

develops and further exacerbates

thecrisis by cutting across world
trade.
The economic crisis in the
Stalinist world is rooted in the
bureaucratic mismanagement
and corruption of the ruling
bureaucratic castes. The advantages of the planned economy
over the anarchy of capitalism
are continually lessened by the
inability of the bureaucracy to
plan efficiently. Only the
democratic participation and
control of the working class can
fully realize the potential of a
planned
economy.
The
bureaucracy can no more overcomethe contradictions of their
system that can the capitalist
class in their’s.
Reaganomics

The developing world crisis
has not been overcome by
Reagan’s upswing. The opposite is the case. The upswing
of the past 3 years has resulted
in the highest level of debt in US
history. The total debt of US con-

sumers, corporations, farmers
and state and federal governments rose 14% in 1984 to $7.1
trillion ($7,100,000,000,000).
The current upswing has
lasted longer thanthe average of
post-war upswings.This is partly due to the increased size of the
U.S. deficit. Another factor has
been thefall in the price of raw
materials, which has transferred
$70
billion
from
the
underdeveloped countries to the
advanced capitalist countries. .
However,it has also increased
the debt of the underdeveloped
countries which will push forward the revolution in these
areas in the coming years.
Reagan’s response to this has
been to increase-US intervention, shown by recent events in
Central America, Libya and

Angola.

— WORKING CL.
CAPITALISM At
Recession

Reagan’s upswing will collapse in a new and deeper
recession than the recession
of 1981-82. Inflation will soar
again. Indebted countries and
consumers, corporations and

farmers will default on their
debts and threaten banks. A new
1929 collapse will begin to apy
pear onthe horizon.
)
This threatens a returnto the
1930's for the advanced capit*
alist countries. Already “40
million are unemployed in the 24
advanced capitalist countries
grouped in the Organization for
Economic

Cooperation

and

Development (OECD).
For the underdeveloped world
it means an absolute nightmare.

Living standards fell for the majority of people in these countries
during the years of the post war
boom. Now, with the boom over,

outright starvation is the prospect. 50 million people starve to death each year and 700 million
are either unemployed or underemployed in this part of the
world.
For the working class and
peasants in Eastern Europe and
Russia the developing crisis
means an attempt by the
buraucracy to reduce their living
standards and to speed up the
rate of work. This will be accompanied by increased repression.
The coming period in world
history will be one of increased instability, with the
working class and peasants in
the West rising to end
capitalism and landlordism
and the working class and
peasants in the East rising to
end Stalinism.
Developments in
one aréa or in one country can

only be understood if viewed as
of this world crisis and
world revolution that is
unfolding.
Philippines

It is in this context that the fall
of the twenty-year dictatorship of
Marcos in the Philippines is to be
understood. In the Philippines,
70% of the populationis suffering from malnutrition while 43%
of the workforce is unemployed
or semi-employed. Less than one
per cent of the population controls 70% of the economy. While
Marcos andthe capitalist class
were getting richer and richer,
tens of thousands of young
children were dying of hunger
and
malnutrition-related
disease.
In the last two years, the
economy of the Philippines experienced a massive decline —
4.6% in real production in 1985.
As a result, the regime of Mar-

cos started to crumble underthe
increasing pressure of the
masses. The numberofstrikes

all the opportunities presented to
them, thus condemning the
e-workers to defeat. The leadership of Solidarity did not comprehendthatit is impossible to
achieve gradual reform of the
Stalinist system, or for a genuine
democratic union movement to
co-exist with the Stalinist
bureaucracy.

The Stalinist castes can only
maintain their rule by ruthless
police-state methods and the
destruction of the opposition of
any kind. The bureaucracy
defends in every way its
privilege, power, income and

erid to the dictatorial rule and prestige against every challenge
of the working class.
privileges of the bureaucracy.
Solidarity was set up by the
representatives of the workers in

400 factories in Gdansk and the
membershipof the organization
swelled to 10 million. The sweep
and powerof the Polish revolution and the Polish working class
is shown in the building of
Solidarity. In three months the
Polish workers built a union
with 10 million members. This
is the fastest growth of a
union in world history.
Solidarity was not in any way
a movementagainst socialism as
Reagan and other capitalist
politicians tried to presentit for
propagandistic reasons. The
demands of the workers suppor‘ting the Solidarity movement
was democratic change in the
direction of bringing the planned economy and state ownership
under workers’ control and
management.At no time did the
Polish working class ever demanda return to capitalism.

Then, after a period of com-

promise, the regime struck and
imposed martial law and jailed
hundreds ofactivists in Poland.
Solidarity was forced underground and the movement
was defeated. However, that does
not mean thatpolitical revolution is over in the Eastern European states and the Soviet
Union. The working class
created during thelast 40 years
of industrial developmentis extremely powerful as was shown
in the case of Hungary and
Poland. With even a few dozen
activists armed with a clear
perspective and program for the
political revolution at the beginningof the events in 1980, a genuine workers’ democracy could
have beenestablished in Poland.
The bureaucratic regime was
suspended in mid-air when the
massive generalstrikes occured.
The “communist” party was
totally isolated in the face of

mass oppositon and it could only rely on the security forces to
deal with the situation.
There was no force in Poland
preventing the working class
from taking state power. It was
held back from this task only by
the mistaken policies of the
leadership. The policies of the
Solidarity leaders were heavily
influenced by “dissident” intellectuals and the Catholic
Church to whom theyturnedfor
advice. Incapable of understand-

ing laws of revolution and the

processes they wereinvolved in,
Walesa and the otherleaders of
Solidarity limited the movement
to demands for partial reforms
and attempted to compromise
with the bureaucracy.

Whatthe Polish working class
needed was: a decisive and
audacious revolutionary policy
and internationalist appeal to

the working class in Russia, East

Germany, Hungary etc., to rise
with them and overthrow their
own bureaucracies.

The launching of the Congress of South

step forward for the working class of all

Africa. In the very center of racist and
capitalist reaction black South African

workers have built the strongest and most
democratic trade union movement on the
whole continent.

In this article reprinted from the British

the movement against the
bosses and the murderous

Fighting spirit
The workers’ fighting
spirit was expressed in the
speech of Elijah Bardyi, vicepresident of the SA NUM
ard ‘now president of
COSATU. Described in the
press as ‘‘a stalwart of the
African National Congress

before it was outlawed’’,

comrade Barayi “‘spelt out
the socialist aspirations of

workers’ intention of na-

tionalising the mites and big

(Guardian, 2 December
1985).
He delivered a militant
ultimatum to Botha, drawing

thunderous

applause.

“COSATU gives Botha six

monthsto get rid of passes.
If that does not take place we
will burn the passes...

“*T want to give PWBotha
a last warning to get rid of
the pass laws and to

withdraw the troops from

country burns’’.

If carried into effect in a
full-scale national campaign,
this ultimatum can provide
the focusfor the entire mass
movement in the period

ahead, and help lift union

membership towards the
million mark: COSATU,
together with the youth, in a
united front with the UDF,
must back up the ultimatum

While the activists in SA
still show themselvestireless

the mass movement has

begun slightly to recede
(despite continued eruptions), because of the difficulty of carrying the insurrectionary movementin its

flaming township streets.

Prolonged stalemate has

meant the state gradually (if
only temporarily) regaining

the upper hand.
The resulting frustration

of the fighting youth had
begun to open a dangerous

rift with unions slow to move

BRITISH LABOR: ‘ITS

The Thatcher government

war against the British working class and its organizations.
Conditions have become
unbearable in Britain. Official
unemploymenthas reached 13%,
and savage cuts have been implemented in social programs
andthe national health service.
It is in the inner cities where conditions have deteriorated the
fastest, and Liverpoolis one of
the hardst hit. Its official
unemploymentrate is 25%.

nothing changed. ~An exampleofthis is the Affirmative
Action program instituted
AT&T in the early
1970's. Through a court decree
womenand minority males who
were adequately qualified for
promotions were given super
seniority rights over qualified
white males. At the end of the
five year period 6.7% of women
were promoted to middle and upper management jobs as compared to the 2.1% in 1972. In
skilled jobs women increased

over 40%, with a 25% jump in
the last four years. The position
of black womenis a double horror. In 1983, nearly 42% of black

families were headed by single

mothers, up from 40.3% in 1980
and 22.4% in 1960. Their median
family income was $7,999 in
1983, compared with $13,761 for
households headed by white
women.
Womenare also denied adequate health services, materni-

ty leave from their jobs, health
facilities and are targets of sexual harassment and violence.
60% of working women have
no maternity leave. In a
survey of
6 million
employers it was found that
only 1800 offer some type of
child care.
Legislation can not put an end
to the horrific conditions working class womenface.
The only lasting gains
made by womenhavebeen those
won through the Labor
Movement.
Presently 34% of trade union
members — 6 million in all — are
women. Unionized women, compared to nonunion, have in-

creased pay, job security, senority rights and benefits. The
clerical workers at Columbia
University recently won a union
contract with an 8.5% wagein-

from 6% to 14%. However, dur-

ing this same period the

at AT&T declined by 10,000,

Shealso said duringthe interview thatthe impact of the strike
has served to pull the union
closer together. 95% of the union
has notcrossed the picket lines
and are putting up a tough fight.
“Our membership is extremely strong. They have recognized
the need to band together as a
family. They have recognized
that we are brothers and sisters.
They recognize the importance of
having a relationship with other
unions. Since the strike, they
realize the responsiblity of being

This victory was in the minds of

CURFEW
The particular attacks the
youth in Seattle have faced have
been massive. Big Business provides no affordable leisure
facilities for Seattle’s youth.
Addedto this their henchmen in
the City Council (Republican and
Democrats) have outlawed under
18 year olds from attendinggigs,
and the State Legislature proposed a curfew for under 17 year

olds. Such a curfew already exists in neighboring Oregon.
“From the start the Y.D.C. explained that these attacks were
not isolated, but a part of a more
general attack by the corporations who control society, on
society’s most rebellious section:
the youth. If the youth are to be
teduced to semi-slavelike condi-

tions big business, and through
it the state, must attempt to

pacify or at least subdue the best
qualities of youth: their energy
and enthusiasm. While on the
other hand an organized campaign against these attacks
should raise these qualities.

all three defendants from the
Novemberpolice riot have
had their charges dropped or
reduced to a minor misdemeanor. In Marchthe State
Legislature dropped its proposed curfew law on a
technicality. Their motives
are clear: drop the issue now
and the movement may
subside.
But the Y.D.C. understands
that it was a tactical move and
they'll be back again with full
force.
This Y.D.C. victory will not
serve to subdue the movement
but to organize it. When we
organize, particularly with labor,
the bosses and thestate can be
forced back. From this victory we
must build the Y.D.C. forces

Meatpackers at the George Hormel Com-

pany plant in Austin, Minnesota have been

on strike since August 17, 1985. Their struggle against the most profitable U.S. pork pro-

cessor, and against the policies of their
union’s national leadership, continues in spite
of a numberof serious set-backs.
Hormel has won concessions
from its Austin’ workers since
1978 by playing on workers’
fears pf plant closures and increasing
international competition in a declining market. In

Nationalization

The current fightback against
concessions in the meatpacking
industry makes it clear that
meatpackers are unwilling to accept further lowering oftheir living standards. Developing a
fighting nationalleadership with
a strategy of industrial action
wouldstart to turn aroundtheir

declining position. But the basic
problem of overcapacity in the
meatpacking industry will eventually have to be confronted.
Workers cannot continue to win
higher wages if high profit and
enormous salaries and bonuses
for executives are maintained.
An industry shakeout is

predicted, with mergers, bank-

ruptcies, plant closures, and
layoffs, resulting in renewed
pressure on wages and conditions. A new recession would add
to thése pressures. In seeking a

unions. They continually portray
union leaders as dictators and the
unions themselves as centers of
Mafia activity.

Smears
Despite these smears support for

labor unions far outweighs the

number of workers organized in
unions. In a~ July 1985 poll in
Business Week magazine it was

shown that 73% of Americans
agreed that unions improve wages

and conditions. Even in the South
68% agreed wth this. This shows a

huge level of support for labor and

an understanding of the key role

unions haveplayed in raising living
standards for workers.

In 1985, however, only 18% of
the workforce is organized in

unions. Big business and its press
have been attempting to prove that
unions are a thing of the past and
no longer relevant. To prove this

they point to a fall in the percen-

tage of workers organized from

35% in the 1940's to 18% in 1985.

But these figures hide the most
important process in the last 40
years. The workforce has increased

from 64 million in 1946 to 110

million in 1985. Most of these jobs

appeared in new industries,

jally the service industries,

which were not unionized. Thus the
growth in the size of the working
class must be taken into account
when considering the reduction in
the percentage of workers organiz-

ed.

19 Million

There are 19 million workers
organized in unions today. This is 4
million more than were organized in
1955 at the time of the merger of

the AFL and CIO. This makes the
labor movement potentially the
most powerful force in American
society today and the largest
organized trade union movementin
the world.

The responsibility for the low
level of organization-lies not with

an anti-union workforce but with
the policies of the trade union
leaders. The laborleaders failed to
mount a campaign to organize this
new growing workforce. During the
post-war period the AFL-CIO spent
only 3% ofits budget on organizing
while they spent 25% on “‘international affairs’.
Post-War Boom
During the last 40 years the

policies of the labor leaders have

been based on “labor-management
co-operation”. This policy had a

certain base due to the post-war
boom. The boom allowed the corporations to make huge profits,

enabling labor to win increased
wages for workers. With a powerful
working class on one side, and
super profits on the other side,

union leaders won improved con-

tracts and increased prestige. A

vast section of the working class
reached living standards never

before dreamed of while the living
standardsof the union leaders rose
above those they represented.
Organize
The present crisis and the attacks on labor have caught the

labor leaders unprepared. But
pressure is growing on them to
organize the millions of workers
outside organized labor. SEIU

spent 30% of its budget on organizing in 1985. At the 1985 AFL-CIO

convention Lane Kirkland, presi-

dent of the AFL-CIO,said; ‘‘A new
labor force has grown up around us
and the trade union share ofit has
dropped. But the good news is that

we havea hell of a lot more people
to organize, and we mean to
organize them”’.
Labor must mobilize its huge
resources to reach the ear of
millions of workers and especially
the young workers facing poverty
wages, poor conditions and job insecurity in fast-food restaurants,

the service industry, small shops,
sweat shops, and other non-union
workplaces across the country. The

main message of this campaign

should be: “Wages and benefits of

union members are 30% higher

than non-union”.
