<cite>Labor Militant</cite> was published by a US socialist group also called **Labor Militant** (**LM**).
LM was founded in 1986 as a new section of the
Committee for a Workers’ International (<abbr>CWI</abbr>), which was founded in 1974.
The <abbr>CWI</abbr> is based in England;
during the 1980s its British supporters were members of the Labour Party
known as the Militant tendency due to the newspaper that they published, called <cite>Militant</cite>.[^militant]

LM was involved in the creation of the defunct

In 1997, LM renamed its newspaper **<cite>Justice</cite>**.[^justice]
In 1999, LM changed its name to
**<a rel="external" href="https://www.socialistalternative.org">Socialist Alternative</a>** (**SA**).
SA published <cite>Justice</cite> until 2013, when it renamed the newspaper **<cite>Socialist Alternative</cite>**.[^socialist-alternative]
In 2020, SA and a majority of the <abbr>CWI</abbr> sections formed a new international association called the
