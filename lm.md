### History

**<cite>Labor Militant</cite>**
(<abbr>ISSN</abbr> <a rel="external" href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/labor-militant/oclc/15266902">0892-4902</a>)
was a semi-monthly newspaper which ran from 1986 to 1997.
Its regular features included editorials, US, international, and labor news, interviews, historical perspectives, activist reports, book reviews, letters to the editor, congratulations, and condolences.

<cite>Labor Militant</cite> was published by a US socialist group also called **Labor Militant** (**LM**).
LM was founded in 1986 as a new section of the
**Committee for a Workers’ International** (**<abbr>CWI</abbr>**),
which was founded in 1974.
The <abbr>CWI</abbr> is based in England;
during the 1980s its British supporters were members of the Labour Party
known as the **Militant tendency** due to the newspaper that they published, called **<cite>Militant</cite>**
(<abbr>ISSN</abbr> <a rel="external" href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/militant/oclc/19365820">0144-9257</a>).

In 1997, LM renamed its newspaper **<cite>Justice</cite>**
(<abbr>OCLC</abbr> <a rel="external" href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/justice/oclc/811779790">811779790</a>).
In 1999, LM changed its name to
**<a rel="external" href="https://www.socialistalternative.org">Socialist Alternative</a>** (**SA**).
SA published <cite>Justice</cite> until 2013, when it renamed the newspaper **<cite>Socialist Alternative</cite>**
(<abbr>ISSN</abbr> <a rel="external" href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/socialist-alternative/oclc/905231108">2638-3349</a>).
In 2020, SA and a majority of the <abbr>CWI</abbr> sections formed a new international association called the
**<a rel="external" href="https://internationalsocialist.net/">International Socialist Alternative</a>**
(**<abbr>ISA</abbr>**).
